## 🚨 Crisis Theory

### Definition of Crisis

**Crisis**: A time-limited period of psychological disequilibrium when usual coping mechanisms fail to resolve a problem or stressor.

**Key Characteristics**:
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         CHARACTERISTICS OF CRISIS                     │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  ✓ Triggered by specific event (stressor)            │
│  ✓ Perceived as overwhelming                          │
│  ✓ Usual coping mechanisms inadequate                 │
│  ✓ High level of anxiety/distress                     │
│  ✓ Disrupted functioning                              │
│  ✓ Time-limited (typically 4-6 weeks)                 │
│  ✓ Can lead to growth OR decline                      │
│  ✓ Opportunity for intervention and change            │

### Phases of Crisis

```
PHASE 1: EXPOSURE TO STRESSOR
        ↓
        Anxiety increases
        Usual coping attempted

PHASE 2: COPING FAILS
        ↓
        Anxiety escalates
        Functioning impaired
        Try new coping methods

PHASE 3: EMERGENCY COPING
        ↓
        All resources mobilized
        Problem redefined or given up
        Severe anxiety, confusion

PHASE 4: CRISIS
        ↓
        Complete disorganization
        Personality disintegration possible
        INTERVENTION CRITICAL
```

**NCLEX Tip**: Crisis is self-limiting (4-6 weeks). Person will either resolve it (with or without help) or deteriorate.

### Types of Crises

#### 1. Maturational (Developmental) Crisis

**Definition**: Normal life transitions that cause stress

**Examples**:
- Starting school
- Puberty, adolescence
- Leaving home
- Marriage
- Becoming a parent
- Midlife transitions
- Retirement
- Aging, physical decline

**Nursing Focus**: These are expected; help patient develop coping skills for life transition

---

#### 2. Situational Crisis

**Definition**: Unexpected, external events

**Examples**:
- Death of loved one
- Divorce, separation
- Job loss, financial crisis
- Serious illness/injury
- Natural disaster
- Assault, violence
- Accident
- Unwanted pregnancy

**Nursing Focus**: Unpredictable; requires immediate support and mobilization of resources

---

#### 3. Adventitious Crisis

**Definition**: Major disasters affecting many people simultaneously

**Examples**:
- Terrorist attacks
- Natural disasters (earthquake, hurricane, tsunami)
- Pandemic
- War
- Mass shootings
- Major accidents (plane crash, building collapse)

**Nursing Focus**: Community-wide response needed; may cause PTSD; long-term recovery

D = DEPRESSION (or other mental illness)

P = PREVIOUS ATTEMPT (Strongest predictor!)

E = ETHANOL/SUBSTANCE ABUSE

R = RATIONAL THINKING LOSS (psychosis, cognitive impairment)

S = SOCIAL SUPPORT LACKING (isolated, alone)

O = ORGANIZED PLAN (specific + lethal = higher risk)

N = NO SPOUSE (single, divorced, widowed)

S = SICKNESS (chronic illness, pain, terminal)
```

---

### Additional Risk Factors

**Psychiatric**:
- Depression, bipolar disorder
- Schizophrenia

### Suicide Assessment - Ask Directly!

**ASK DIRECTLY - It does NOT plant the idea!**

```
SCREENING QUESTIONS:
  ✓ "Are you thinking about hurting yourself?"
  ✓ "Are you thinking about suicide?"
  ✓ "Have you ever tried to hurt yourself before?"

IF YES, ASSESS PLAN:
  ✓ "Do you have a plan?"
  ✓ "What is your plan?"
  ✓ "Do you have access to [means]?" (pills, gun, etc.)
  ✓ "When are you planning to do this?"
  ✓ "Have you done anything to prepare?" (gotten pills, written note)

ASSESS INTENT:
  ✓ "Do you intend to act on these thoughts?"
  ✓ "What has stopped you so far?"
  ✓ "Is there anything that would stop you?"

ASSESS LETHALITY:
  High Lethality: Gun, hanging, jumping, carbon monoxide
  Moderate: Overdose, cutting wrists
  Lower: Superficial cuts (but take ALL seriously!)
```

### Suicide Risk Levels

| Risk Level | Characteristics | Interventions |
|------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **High** | Plan + Means + Intent + No protective factors | • 1:1 constant observation<br>• Remove ALL harmful objects<br>• Psychiatric hospitalization<br>• May need involuntary commitment<br>• Patient gown, no belongings |

Signed: _____________ Date: _____________
```

**IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS**:
- NOT a substitute for observation and other precautions
- NOT legally binding
- Some patients will break contract

## 🔪 Self-Harm vs. Suicide

### Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI)

**Definition**: Deliberate self-inflicted harm WITHOUT intent to die

**Common Methods**:
- Cutting (most common)
- Burning
- Hitting/punching self or objects
- Head-banging
- Picking at wounds

**Reasons** (NOT suicide attempt):
- Emotional regulation (release emotional pain)
- Self-punishment
- Feel something (combat numbness)
- Distraction from worse pain
- Control over something
- Communicate distress

**Key Difference from Suicide**:
- **NSSI**: Intent is to relieve emotional pain, not die
- **Suicide attempt**: Intent is to end life

---

### Assessment & Intervention for Self-Harm

**Assessment**:
```
  ✓ "What were you feeling before you cut?"
  ✓ "What were you hoping would happen?"
  ✓ "Did you want to die?"
  ✓ "What did you feel after?"
  ✓ "How long have you been doing this?"
  ✓ "What else have you tried to feel better?"
```

**Nursing Interventions**:
```
IMMEDIATE:
  ✓ Treat wounds matter-of-factly (don't punish or overly attend)
  ✓ Assess suicide risk (separate but related)
  ✓ Remove sharp objects

ONGOING:
  ✓ Teach alternative coping strategies:
    - Ice cube on skin
    - Rubber band snap on wrist
    - Squeeze ice
    - Intense exercise
    - Draw red lines instead of cutting
  ✓ Teach emotion regulation skills
  ✓ Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) referral
  ✓ Address underlying issues (trauma, emotion regulation)
  ✓ Don't focus excessively on self-harm behavior
  ✓ Reinforce use of healthy coping
```

**NCLEX Tip**: Self-harm ≠ suicide attempt, but both need assessment and intervention. Patients who self-harm have higher suicide risk overall.

## 📝 Practice Questions

<details>
<summary>Question 1: A depressed patient who has been withdrawn suddenly appears happy, gives away belongings, and says "Everything will be better soon." What should the nurse do FIRST?</summary>

**Answer**: Assess for suicidal ideation and implement suicide precautions.

**Rationale**: Sudden mood improvement in a depressed patient is a RED FLAG for suicide risk. The patient may have decided on a suicide plan, which provides relief (explains improved mood). Giving away belongings and "everything will be better" are warning signs. This is a psychiatric emergency requiring immediate assessment and safety measures.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 2: A patient states "I'm thinking about suicide but I would never do it because of my religious beliefs." What risk level is this?</summary>

**Answer**: Low to moderate risk. Continue assessment and monitoring.

**Rationale**: Patient has suicidal ideation (a concern) but strong protective factor (religious beliefs). Not imminent danger, but needs ongoing assessment, mental health referral, safety planning, and monitoring. Don't dismiss ideation, but protective factor reduces immediate risk.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 3: Which question is MOST important when assessing suicide risk?</summary>

**Answer**: "Have you ever attempted suicide before?"

**Rationale**: Previous suicide attempt is the STRONGEST predictor of future attempt. This is the most critical piece of history. While plan, means, and current ideation are important, past attempt is the highest risk factor.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 4: A patient says "I'm going to kill myself." What is the nurse's FIRST priority?</summary>

**Answer**: Ensure patient safety by staying with patient and implementing suicide precautions.

**Rationale**: SAFETY is always the first priority. Never leave a suicidal patient alone. Immediate actions: stay with patient, call for help, remove harmful objects, implement observation protocol. Assessment and planning continue, but safety interventions start immediately.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 5: What is the primary goal of crisis intervention?</summary>

**Answer**: Return the patient to pre-crisis level of functioning.

**Rationale**: The main goal is to help the person return to their baseline functioning as quickly as possible. Crisis intervention is short-term and focused on immediate problem resolution, not long-term therapy or personality change.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 6: A patient admitted for suicidal ideation says "I'm fine now. I want to go home." What should the nurse consider?</summary>

**Answer**: Patient may be planning to attempt suicide at home. Continue safety precautions and notify physician.

**Rationale**: Suicidal patients may claim to be "fine" to get discharged so they can attempt suicide. This requires careful assessment, not immediate discharge. Physician must evaluate. Patient safety is priority over patient's stated wishes to leave.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 7: Which patient is at HIGHEST risk for suicide?</summary>

**Answer**: 75-year-old white male, widowed, with terminal cancer and history of depression.

**Rationale**: Multiple high-risk factors: elderly, male, white, recent loss (spouse), chronic/terminal illness, mental illness history. Elderly white males have the highest suicide completion rate. This combination of factors creates very high risk.
