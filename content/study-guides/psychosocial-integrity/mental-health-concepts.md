## 🔐 Psychiatric Hospitalization & Patient Rights

### Types of Admission

├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  1. VOLUNTARY ADMISSION                               │

## 🚨 Safety & Milieu Management

### Suicide Risk Assessment

**High-Risk Factors**:

```
SAD PERSONS Scale (Risk Factors):

S = Sex (male)
A = Age (<19 or >45, especially elderly)
D = Depression
P = Previous attempt (strongest predictor)
E = Ethanol/substance abuse
R = Rational thinking loss (psychosis)
S = Social support lacking
O = Organized plan (specific, lethal)
N = No spouse (divorced, widowed, single)
S = Sickness (chronic illness, pain)
```

**Assessment Questions** (Ask directly!):
1. "Are you thinking about hurting yourself?"
2. "Are you thinking about suicide?"
3. "Do you have a plan?"
4. "Do you have access to means?" (guns, pills, etc.)
5. "When are you planning to do it?"
6. "What has stopped you so far?"

**NCLEX Tip**: ALWAYS ask directly about suicide. Asking does NOT plant the idea!

---

### Suicide Precautions

| Level | Description | Interventions |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **High Risk** | Active plan, means, intent | • 1:1 constant observation<br>• Remove all harmful objects<br>• Patient in gown, no belongings<br>• Arm's length at all times<br>• Bathroom supervision |
| **Moderate Risk** | Thoughts, no plan | • 15-minute checks<br>• Limited harmful objects<br>• Know location always<br>• Contract for safety |
| **Low Risk** | History, no current ideation | • Regular monitoring<br>• Open communication<br>• Safety plan in place |

**Contract for Safety** (No-Harm Contract):
- "I agree not to harm myself or others."
- "I will tell staff if I have thoughts of self-harm."
- NOT a replacement for other precautions
- NOT legally binding
- Can provide therapeutic value

---

### Violence/Aggression Management

**Warning Signs of Escalating Aggression**:
- Increased pacing
- Loud voice, pressured speech

## 💡 Clinical Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Suicidal Patient

2. ✓ Notify physician immediately
3. ✓ Implement suicide precautions (1:1 observation)
4. ✓ Remove all potentially harmful objects
5. ✓ Patient likely needs continued hospitalization
6. ✓ Document plan and actions

**NOT**: ❌ "You don't really want to do that." ❌ Let patient go home.

---

### Scenario 2: Manic Patient

**Patient** is pacing rapidly, talking constantly, jumping from topic to topic, not eating or sleeping.

**Priority Nursing Actions**:
1. ✓ Reduce stimulation - quiet area
2. ✓ High-calorie finger foods (too active to sit)
3. ✓ Set firm, consistent limits

## 📝 Practice Questions

<details>
<summary>Question 1: A patient admitted involuntarily says "I'm leaving right now!" What should the nurse do?</summary>

**Answer**: Explain that the patient was admitted because they are a danger to themselves or others and cannot leave without a physician's order.

**Rationale**: Involuntarily committed patients cannot leave at will. They were admitted because they met criteria (danger to self, danger to others, or gravely disabled). The nurse should explain the situation calmly and involve the physician. The patient has the right to legal counsel and can challenge the commitment in court.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 2: Which patient is at HIGHEST risk for suicide?</summary>

**Answer**: 68-year-old white male with depression, previous suicide attempt, who just started antidepressants and reports improved energy.

**Rationale**: Multiple high-risk factors: male, elderly, depression, previous attempt (strongest predictor). Additionally, suicide risk INCREASES when depression begins to lift because patient regains energy to act on suicidal thoughts. This is critical time for close monitoring.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 3: A patient taking haloperidol develops severe muscle rigidity, fever of 105°F, and confusion. What should the nurse suspect?</summary>

**Answer**: Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) - STOP medication immediately and notify physician.

**Rationale**: NMS is a life-threatening reaction to antipsychotics. Classic triad: fever, rigidity, altered mental status. Also see elevated CPK, unstable vitals. This is a medical emergency requiring immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic and ICU care.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 4: A patient's lithium level is 1.8 mEq/L. What should the nurse do?</summary>

**Answer**: Hold the medication and notify the physician immediately. Assess for toxicity signs.

**Rationale**: Therapeutic lithium range is 0.6-1.2 mEq/L. Levels >1.5 are toxic. At 1.8, patient is at risk for moderate toxicity (ataxia, confusion, seizures). Medication should be held and physician notified. Monitor for worsening symptoms.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 5: A patient with schizophrenia says "The FBI put a chip in my brain to control me." What is the BEST response?</summary>

**Answer**: "I understand that you believe that, but I don't see any evidence of that. You are safe here."

**Rationale**: Don't argue with delusions or reinforce them. Present reality gently without demanding patient accept it. Focus on safety and feelings rather than the delusion itself. Arguing will damage trust and is ineffective.
