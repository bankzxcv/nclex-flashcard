### Why Victims Stay

**Common Reasons** (Not excuses, but realities):
```
  • Fear (of being killed, escalation)
  • Economic dependence
  • Children (fear of losing custody, harming them)
  • Isolation (no support system)
  • Low self-esteem ("I deserve this")
  • Cultural/religious beliefs
  • Love for partner (believes they'll change)
  • Shame, embarrassment
  • Nowhere to go
  • Immigration status concerns
  • Hope for change
  • Fear not being believed
  • Learned helplessness
```

**MOST DANGEROUS TIME**: When victim leaves or tries to leave. Risk of homicide increases 70%.

---

### Assessment & Screening

**Universal Screening**: ALL women should be screened routinely

**How to Ask**:
```
INTERVIEW ALONE (never with partner present):
  ✓ "Do you feel safe at home?"
  ✓ "Has your partner ever hurt you or threatened you?"
  ✓ "Has your partner ever forced you to do something sexually?"
  ✓ "Are you afraid of your partner?"
  ✓ "Do you feel controlled by your partner?"

CREATE SAFE ENVIRONMENT:
  • Private room, door closed
  • Partner not present
  • Don't use family members as interpreters
  • Non-judgmental approach
```

## 🎯 Key NCLEX Concepts

### Mnemonic: **ABUSED**

For recognizing abuse:

- **A**ppearance: Poor hygiene, inappropriate clothing, fearful
- **B**ruises: Various stages, unusual locations/patterns
- **U**nexplained injuries or explanation doesn't match
- **S**tatements from victim (believe them!)
- **E**vasive answers, conflicting stories
- **D**elay in seeking treatment

---

### Mnemonic: **REPORT**

For nursing actions:

- **R**ecognize signs/indicators
- **E**nsure immediate safety
- **P**rovide support, non-judgmental care
- **O**bjective documentation
- **R**eport to authorities (CPS, APS, police)
- **T**reat injuries, connect with resources

---

### Documentation: Objective Language

| Instead of... ❌ | Write... ✅ |
|------------------|-------------|
| "Patient is abused" | "Patient reports partner hit her" |
| "Obvious abuse" | "Multiple bruises in various stages of healing" |
| "Parent is lying" | "History inconsistent with injury pattern" |
| "Battered woman" | "Patient reports intimate partner violence" |

## 💡 Clinical Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Suspected Child Abuse

**Situation**: 3-year-old brought to ED by mother for "fall down stairs." Child has multiple bruises of different colors on back, buttocks, and inner thighs. Mother seems unconcerned, story changes when repeated.

**Red Flags**:
- Bruises in unusual locations (not typical fall areas)
- Different stages of healing (multiple colors)
- History inconsistent
- Caregiver unconcerned

**Nursing Actions**:
1. ✓ Assess child fully (may reveal other injuries)
2. ✓ Interview child separately if age-appropriate
3. ✓ Document objectively: location, size, color of each bruise
4. ✓ Photograph per protocol
5. ✓ Document mother's statements in quotes
6. ✓ Report to CPS immediately (don't wait)
7. ✓ Notify physician, social work
8. ✓ Child likely needs protective custody
9. ✓ NEVER accuse parent directly

---

### Scenario 2: Elder Financial Exploitation

**Situation**: 80-year-old with dementia, normally well-kept, comes to clinic with granddaughter. Patient seems malnourished, wearing soiled clothes. Granddaughter recently moved in and now has power of attorney. Bills are unpaid despite adequate pension.

**Red Flags**:
- Signs of neglect despite adequate resources
- Recent POA with uninvolved relative
- Unpaid bills
- Cognitive impairment makes elder vulnerable

**Nursing Actions**:
1. ✓ Interview patient alone if possible
2. ✓ Assess cognitive status, nutritional status
3. ✓ Ask about finances, who manages money
4. ✓ Document objective findings
5. ✓ Report to Adult Protective Services
6. ✓ May need legal guardian appointed
7. ✓ Connect with social services

---

### Scenario 3: Intimate Partner Violence

**Situation**: 28-year-old woman, 5 months pregnant, presents to ED for "falling down stairs." Has bruises on face and abdomen. Boyfriend hovers, answers all questions for her. She avoids eye contact, seems anxious.

**Red Flags**:
- Injuries during pregnancy (high risk for IPV)
- Abdominal bruising (dangerous for fetus)
- Partner controlling, won't leave
- Patient fearful, submissive

**Nursing Actions**:
1. ✓ Separate patient from partner (mandatory): "We need to examine her privately"
2. ✓ Screen for IPV when alone: "Are you safe at home?"
3. ✓ If discloses abuse:
   - Assess immediate danger
   - Document thoroughly (quote patient's words)
   - Photograph injuries
   - Assess fetal well-being
   - Safety planning
   - Provide hotline number, resources
   - Report if required by state

## 📝 Practice Questions

<details>
<summary>Question 1: A nurse suspects a 4-year-old is being abused. What should the nurse do FIRST?</summary>

**Answer**: Report suspicions to Child Protective Services.

**Rationale**: Nurses are mandatory reporters. Must report ANY suspicion of child abuse - don't need proof. This is a legal and ethical obligation. Failure to report can result in criminal charges and license discipline. Document objectively and report immediately.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 2: Which injury pattern is MOST suspicious for child abuse?</summary>

**Answer**: Bruises in various stages of healing on the back, buttocks, and inner thighs.

**Rationale**: Multiple bruises of different colors indicate injuries at different times. Location on back, buttocks, inner thighs is unusual for accidental injury (typical accidents: shins, knees, elbows, forehead). This pattern is highly suspicious for intentional abuse.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 3: A woman with multiple bruises tells the nurse she "walked into a door." What should the nurse do?</summary>

**Answer**: Document her statement and the injuries objectively, screen for intimate partner violence when alone.

**Rationale**: "Walking into door" is common excuse for IPV. Nurse should screen all women for IPV in private setting. Document exact statement in quotes. Provide resources even if patient denies. Don't argue with explanation but document concerns objectively.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 4: What is the MOST important action when interviewing a child about possible abuse?</summary>

**Answer**: Interview the child alone, without the parents present.

**Rationale**: Child will not disclose abuse with abuser present. Privacy is essential. Use age-appropriate language, don't lead or interrogate. Document child's exact words in quotes. Let forensic interviewer do detailed questioning.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 5: An elderly patient with dementia has multiple pressure ulcers, is malnourished, and has poor hygiene. Caregiver says patient refuses care. What should the nurse suspect?</summary>

**Answer**: Elder neglect - report to Adult Protective Services.

**Rationale**: This represents neglect even if caregiver claims patient refuses. Caregiver has responsibility to provide care or arrange for alternative care. Multiple pressure ulcers, malnutrition, poor hygiene indicate failure to meet basic needs. Report to APS for investigation.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 6: What is the MOST dangerous time for a victim of intimate partner violence?</summary>

**Answer**: When leaving or attempting to leave the relationship.

**Rationale**: Homicide risk increases 70% when victim leaves. Abuser's need for control is threatened. This is why victims often return - genuine fear for safety. Safety planning and resources are crucial before leaving.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 7: What should the nurse document when abuse is suspected?</summary>

**Answer**: Objective findings, exact location and description of injuries, patient's statements in quotes.

**Rationale**: Documentation must be factual and objective. Describe injuries precisely (size, shape, color, location). Use quotes for patient's statements. Avoid opinions, accusations, or labels. This documentation may be used in legal proceedings.
