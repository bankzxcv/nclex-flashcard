├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  STAGE 1: ALARM REACTION                              │
│  • "Fight or Flight" response                         │
│  • Sympathetic nervous system activated               │
│  • Increased: HR, BP, respirations, glucose           │
│  • Decreased: Digestion, immune function              │
│  • Adrenaline and cortisol released                   │

## 🛡️ Defense Mechanisms

### Definition

**Defense Mechanisms**: Unconscious psychological strategies used to protect the ego from anxiety and maintain self-esteem.

**Key Points**:
- Usually unconscious
- Can be adaptive or maladaptive
- Everyone uses them
- Become problematic when overused or interfere with functioning

---

### Mature/Adaptive Defense Mechanisms

**Generally healthy and productive**

| Defense | Definition | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Sublimation** | Channel unacceptable impulses into socially acceptable activities | Aggressive feelings → contact sports |
| **Altruism** | Meet own needs by helping others | Breast cancer survivor → support group leader |
| **Humor** | Express feelings through comedy without discomfort to others | Joking about own situation to cope |
| **Suppression** | Consciously postpone dealing with impulse or conflict | "I'll worry about that after the exam" |

**NCLEX Tip**: These are HEALTHY coping mechanisms - encourage their use.

---

### Neurotic/Intermediate Defense Mechanisms

**Common, can be adaptive short-term**

#### Repression

**Definition**: Unconsciously blocking painful thoughts, feelings, or memories from awareness

**Example**:
- Adult has no memory of childhood abuse
- Patient doesn't remember trauma event

**Nursing**: May emerge during therapy; don't force recall

---

#### Suppression

**Definition**: CONSCIOUSLY pushing away disturbing thoughts (healthier than repression)

**Example**:
- "I'll think about my diagnosis after I finish this project"
- Choosing not to dwell on worry

---

#### Displacement

**Definition**: Redirecting emotions from real source to safer substitute

**Example**:
- Angry at boss → yells at spouse at home
- Frustrated with illness → rude to nurse

**Nursing**:
- Recognize you may be substitute target
- Don't take personally
- Set limits on inappropriate behavior
- Help patient identify real source of anger

---

#### Reaction Formation

**Definition**: Expressing opposite of true feelings

**Example**:
- Mother feels resentful of child → overly loving and protective
- Nurse dislikes patient → excessively friendly

**Nursing**: Behavior seems exaggerated or false

---

#### Intellectualization

**Definition**: Excessive use of reasoning to avoid feeling emotions

**Example**:
- Patient discusses cancer diagnosis in purely clinical terms, no emotion
- "The tumor is 3 cm, adenocarcinoma, stage 2..." (avoiding feelings)

**Nursing**:
- Help patient connect with emotions
- "You know a lot about your diagnosis. How do you feel about it?"

---

#### Rationalization

**Definition**: Creating logical explanations to justify unacceptable feelings or behaviors

**Example**:
- Smoker: "My grandfather smoked and lived to 90"
- Failed exam: "The test was unfair anyway"
- Didn't quit drinking: "I don't drink as much as my friends"

**Nursing**:
- Don't argue with rationale
- Gently present reality
- Explore real reasons

---

#### Undoing

**Definition**: Trying to reverse or make up for unacceptable behavior

**Example**:
- Verbally abusive, then brings flowers
- Breaks diet, then exercises excessively

**Nursing**: Recognize pattern; address underlying issue

---

### Immature/Maladaptive Defense Mechanisms

**Generally unhealthy, interfere with functioning**

#### Denial

**Definition**: Refusing to accept reality of a situation

**Example**:
- "I don't have cancer. The test must be wrong."
- Alcoholic: "I don't have a drinking problem"
- Post-MI: "I'm fine, I don't need to change anything"

**Adaptive**: Short-term after devastating news (allows processing)

**Maladaptive**: Long-term, prevents treatment or lifestyle changes

**Nursing**:
- Allow brief denial after bad news
- Gently present reality without arguing
- If prolonged, interfere with care, involve mental health
- Don't strip away denial abruptly (can cause crisis)

---

#### Regression

**Definition**: Reverting to earlier developmental stage behaviors

**Example**:
- Adult patient becomes demanding and childlike when hospitalized
- Child becomes incontinent after new sibling born
- Elderly patient throws tantrums

**Nursing**:
- Recognize as coping mechanism
- Set gentle limits
- Encourage age-appropriate behavior
- Don't shame or punish
- Provide support and reassurance

---

#### Projection

**Definition**: Attributing one's own unacceptable thoughts/feelings to others

**Example**:
- Unfaithful spouse accuses partner of cheating
- Patient angry at nurse: "You don't like me!" (patient doesn't like nurse)
- "Everyone thinks I'm lazy" (I think I'm lazy)

**Nursing**:
- Don't become defensive
- Reflect back: "You seem angry. Tell me about it."
- Help patient recognize own feelings

---

#### Splitting

**Definition**: Viewing people/situations as all good or all bad (no middle ground)

**Example**:
- "Dr. Smith is wonderful! But Dr. Jones is terrible!"
- Day shift nurses are angels, night shift are mean
- Common in Borderline Personality Disorder

**Nursing**:
- Maintain team communication
- Consistent approach from all staff
- Don't take sides
- Point out: "People have both strengths and weaknesses"

---

#### Identification

**Definition**: Modeling behavior after someone else

**Adaptive**: Child identifies with parent values

**Maladaptive**: Victim identifies with abuser (Stockholm syndrome)

---

#### Conversion

**Definition**: Emotional conflict expressed as physical symptom with no organic cause

**Example**:
- Paralysis or blindness with no medical explanation
- Witness to trauma → loses vision
- Conversion Disorder (now called Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder)

**Nursing**:
- Symptoms are REAL to patient (not faking)
- Don't confront as "fake"
- Provide care for symptom
- Psychiatric consultation
- Symptoms often resolve when stressor addressed

---

#### Dissociation

**Definition**: Disconnection from thoughts, feelings, memories, or sense of identity

**Example**:
- Daydreaming during stressful meeting
- Severe: Dissociative Identity Disorder (multiple personalities)
- Depersonalization: feeling detached from oneself
- Derealization: world seems unreal

## 💡 Clinical Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Maladaptive Coping

**Patient** newly diagnosed with diabetes, admits drinking more alcohol since diagnosis, skipping meals, not checking blood sugar.

**Analysis**: Maladaptive coping - substance abuse, denial, non-adherence

**Nursing Actions**:
1. ✓ Non-judgmental approach: "Diabetes is a big adjustment. How are you coping?"
2. ✓ Assess understanding of diabetes and alcohol effects
3. ✓ Explore feelings about diagnosis
4. ✓ Assess for depression

6. ✓ Connect with diabetes support group
7. ✓ Involve diabetes educator
8. ✓ Consider mental health referral

---

### Scenario 2: Defense Mechanism Identification

**Patient** post-MI states: "I feel fine! I don't need to change my diet or quit smoking. My father smoked his whole life and lived to 85."

**Defense Mechanisms**:
- **Denial**: "I feel fine" (refusing to accept heart attack)
- **Rationalization**: "My father smoked and lived to 85" (justifying continued smoking)

**Nursing Approach**:
- ✓ Don't argue or lecture
- ✓ Gently present reality: "You had a heart attack. Your heart needs time to heal."
- ✓ Assess readiness to change
- ✓ Provide information without overwhelming
- ✓ Involve cardiac rehab
- ✓ Allow time for acceptance
- ✓ Support through grief process (loss of old lifestyle)

**Patient** with cancer reports joining support group, practicing meditation, staying active, maintaining social connections, expressing feelings openly.

**Analysis**: ADAPTIVE coping - using multiple healthy strategies

**Nursing Actions**:
1. ✓ Reinforce positive coping: "You're doing a great job managing a difficult situation."
2. ✓ Continue to assess for changes
3. ✓ Provide resources as needed
4. ✓ Encourage continuation of effective strategies

## 📝 Practice Questions

<details>
<summary>Question 1: A patient who just received a terminal cancer diagnosis states "There must be a mistake. I feel fine." What defense mechanism is the patient using?</summary>

**Answer**: Denial

**Rationale**: The patient is refusing to accept the reality of the diagnosis. Denial is common immediately after devastating news and allows time for the person to process information gradually. Short-term denial is adaptive, but prolonged denial interfering with treatment is maladaptive.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 2: A patient angry at their physician yells at the nurse. What defense mechanism is this?</summary>

**Answer**: Displacement

**Rationale**: The patient is redirecting anger from the real source (physician) to a safer target (nurse). The nurse should recognize this, not take it personally, set appropriate limits on behavior, and help the patient identify the real source of anger.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 3: Which coping mechanism is MOST adaptive?</summary>

**Answer**: A patient with a history of violence channels aggressive feelings into kickboxing.

**Rationale**: This is sublimation - channeling unacceptable impulses into socially acceptable activities. This is a mature, healthy defense mechanism that should be encouraged. Other options like substance abuse, social isolation, or denial are maladaptive.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 4: A patient says "I didn't get the promotion because my boss doesn't like me, not because I was late to work every day." What defense mechanism is this?</summary>

**Answer**: Rationalization

**Rationale**: The patient is creating a logical-sounding excuse to justify an unacceptable outcome, avoiding taking responsibility for behavior (chronic lateness). This allows the patient to maintain self-esteem but prevents learning from the situation.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 5: What is the BEST nursing response to a patient using denial about their alcohol problem?</summary>

**Answer**: "Tell me about your drinking pattern. How much and how often do you drink?"

**Rationale**: Use non-judgmental, open-ended questions to gather information. Don't argue with the denial ("Yes, you do have a problem") or enable it ("You're probably right"). Gently present reality with facts and continue therapeutic relationship.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 6: A hospitalized 45-year-old executive becomes demanding, cries easily, and asks the nurse to feed them. What defense mechanism is this?</summary>

**Answer**: Regression

**Rationale**: The patient is reverting to childlike behaviors. Regression is common during hospitalization when people feel vulnerable and sick. The nurse should provide support, set gentle limits, and encourage age-appropriate behavior without shaming the patient.
</details>
