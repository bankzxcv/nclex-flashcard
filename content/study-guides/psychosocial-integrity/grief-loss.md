| "I can't go on" | "You're strong, you'll manage." | "This is incredibly hard. I'm here." |
| "Why did this happen?" | "Everything happens for a reason." | "I don't know. It's natural to ask why." |
| Anger at God | "You shouldn't feel that way." | "You have a right to your feelings." |
| "I should have..." | "Don't blame yourself." | "What makes you feel that way?" |

## 💡 Clinical Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Family Disagreement About Care

**Situation**: Patient with terminal cancer has advance directive for comfort measures only. Family member says "Do everything! Give her IV fluids, tube feeding, CPR if needed!"

**Nursing Response**:
1. ✓ Acknowledge family member's feelings: "I know you want to do everything for your mother."
2. ✓ Review patient's wishes: "Your mother's advance directive states she wants comfort measures only."
3. ✓ Educate: "Tube feeding and IV fluids can actually cause discomfort at end of life. We're focusing on keeping her comfortable."
4. ✓ Clarify: "Comfort measures doesn't mean we're not doing anything. We're managing pain, keeping her comfortable, and allowing family time."
5. ✓ Offer family meeting with physician, social work, chaplain
6. ✓ Support family's grief and need to feel helpful
7. ✓ Honor patient's wishes (autonomy)

---

### Scenario 2: Cultural Considerations

**Situation**: Muslim patient dying. Family requests body not be touched by opposite gender and wants to prepare body themselves.

**Nursing Response**:
1. ✓ Respect cultural/religious wishes
2. ✓ Assign same-gender nurse if possible
3. ✓ After death, allow family to prepare body per their customs
4. ✓ Provide supplies as needed
5. ✓ Ensure privacy
6. ✓ Respect their timeline (burial ASAP in Islam)
7. ✓ Offer support while honoring practices
8. ✓ Document cultural preferences honored

---

### Scenario 3: Identifying Grief Stage

**Patient** newly diagnosed with terminal lung cancer states: "This is ridiculous. The test is wrong. I feel fine! I want a second opinion."

**Stage**: DENIAL (Kübler-Ross Stage 1)

**Nursing Response**:
1. ✓ Allow denial (serves protective purpose initially)
2. ✓ "This is overwhelming news. It's normal to question it."
3. ✓ Support getting second opinion if desired
4. ✓ Don't argue: "The test is definitely correct"
5. ✓ Provide information when patient is ready
6. ✓ Don't force acceptance
7. ✓ Be present and supportive
8. ✓ Reassess over time

## 📝 Practice Questions

<details>
<summary>Question 1: A patient dying of cancer says "Why me? I've lived a good life!" What stage of grief is this?</summary>

**Answer**: Anger (Kübler-Ross Stage 2)

**Rationale**: The patient is expressing rage and questioning "why me," which is characteristic of the anger stage. The nurse should not take the anger personally, should allow the patient to express feelings, and acknowledge that anger is a normal response: "You have a right to feel angry about this."
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 2: A patient's daughter says "If Dad just tries harder with physical therapy, he can get better." The patient has end-stage dementia and can no longer walk. What stage is the daughter in?</summary>

**Answer**: Bargaining (Kübler-Ross Stage 3)

**Rationale**: The daughter is trying to negotiate or find a way to reverse the inevitable. She's looking for a deal ("if he just tries harder, then..."). The nurse should gently present reality while supporting the daughter through her grief process.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 3: What is the BEST nursing response when a dying patient says "I'm scared"?</summary>

**Answer**: "Tell me what frightens you" or "I'm here with you."

**Rationale**: Open-ended question allows patient to express specific fears. Staying with patient provides comfort and support. False reassurance ("Don't be scared" or "Everything will be fine") is non-therapeutic and dismisses the patient's feelings.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 4: A patient died 10 minutes ago. The family is present. What should the nurse do FIRST?</summary>

**Answer**: Allow the family time alone with the body in a private, comfortable setting.

**Rationale**: The family needs time to process, say goodbye, and begin grieving. This is a priority after ensuring death has occurred. Postmortem care can wait. The nurse should offer privacy, ask if they need anything, and allow them to stay as long as they need.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 5: What indicates COMPLICATED grief requiring mental health referral?</summary>

**Answer**: Six months after spouse's death, widow remains in bed all day, unable to work, says life has no meaning.

**Rationale**: This describes complicated/prolonged grief with severe impairment in functioning. While grief is individual and has no set timeline, inability to function, severe depression, and lack of any improvement over time indicate need for professional help. Normal grief gradually improves with ability to function returning.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 6: A patient with terminal illness has "death rattle" (gurgling respirations from secretions). The family is distressed. What should the nurse do?</summary>

**Answer**: Explain that this is normal at end of life and patient is not in distress; may give anticholinergic medication (scopolamine) to reduce secretions.

**Rationale**: Death rattle sounds distressing to family but patient is typically unconscious and not suffering. Educating family reduces their distress. Suctioning is not recommended (uncomfortable, ineffective). Anticholinergics can reduce secretions. Repositioning may help.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 7: Which is appropriate for postmortem care?</summary>

**Answer**: Continue using standard precautions; place identification on body and toe tag; allow family time with body before transport.

**Rationale**: Standard precautions continue after death (body fluids remain infectious). Proper identification is required (patient band, toe tag). Family should be given time with their loved one. Body should be treated with dignity and respect throughout.
