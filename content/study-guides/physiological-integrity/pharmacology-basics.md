# Pharmacology Basics

## Overview
Understanding pharmacological principles is foundational to safe medication administration. Pharmacokinetics (what the body does to the drug) and pharmacodynamics (what the drug does to the body) are essential concepts for nursing practice and frequently tested on the NCLEX.

### Absorption

**Definition**: Movement of drug from site of administration into bloodstream

**Factors Affecting Absorption**:

| Factor | Effect on Absorption |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Route** | IV = 100%, oral varies |
| **Blood flow** | ↑ blood flow = ↑ absorption |
| **Surface area** | ↑ surface area = ↑ absorption |
| **Drug solubility** | Lipid-soluble crosses membranes easier |
| **pH** | Affects ionization and absorption |
| **Food** | Can ↑, ↓, or not affect |
| **First-pass effect** | Oral drugs metabolized in liver before systemic circulation |

**Bioavailability**: Percentage of administered drug that reaches systemic circulation
- **IV**: 100% bioavailability (directly into blood)
- **Oral**: Variable (affected by absorption, first-pass metabolism)

**Routes of Administration** (fastest to slowest absorption):

```
FASTEST → SLOWEST ABSORPTION:
  1. IV (immediate - no absorption phase)
  2. Inhalation
  3. Sublingual
  4. IM
  5. SubQ
  6. Oral
  7. Transdermal (slowest)
```

**First-Pass Effect**:
- Oral drugs absorbed from GI tract → portal circulation → liver → metabolized
- Reduces amount reaching systemic circulation
- **Bypassed by**: IV, IM, SubQ, sublingual, transdermal routes

---

### Distribution

**Definition**: Movement of drug from bloodstream to tissues/organs

**Factors Affecting Distribution**:

**Blood flow**:
- Well-perfused organs (heart, brain, liver, kidneys) receive drug quickly
- Poorly perfused areas (fat, bone) receive drug slowly

**Protein binding**:
- Drugs bind to plasma proteins (mainly albumin)
- **Bound drug** = INACTIVE (can't cross membranes)
- **Free (unbound) drug** = ACTIVE (pharmacologically active)
- **Low albumin** (malnutrition, liver disease) → ↑ free drug → ↑ effects/toxicity

```
Example:
  Normal albumin: 95% bound, 5% free (active)
  Low albumin: 85% bound, 15% free (active)
  → 3× more active drug → increased effects!
```

**Barriers**:
- **Blood-brain barrier**: Protects CNS; only lipid-soluble drugs cross easily
- **Placental barrier**: Not absolute; many drugs cross (teratogenic risk)

**Volume of Distribution (Vd)**:
- Measure of how widely drug distributes in body
- **High Vd**: Extensively distributed to tissues
- **Low Vd**: Remains in bloodstream

---

### Metabolism (Biotransformation)

**Definition**: Chemical alteration of drug (usually to inactive form)

**Primary site**: **Liver** (hepatic metabolism)

**Phase I reactions**: Oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis
- Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP450)

**Phase II reactions**: Conjugation
- Make drug more water-soluble for excretion

**Factors Affecting Metabolism**:

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Age** | Infants (immature), elderly (decreased function) → slower metabolism |
| **Liver disease** | ↓ metabolism → ↑ drug levels → toxicity risk |
| **Genetics** | Enzyme variations affect metabolism rate |
| **Drug interactions** | Induction or inhibition of enzymes |
| **Nutritional status** | Malnutrition affects enzyme production |

**Enzyme Induction**:
- Some drugs stimulate enzyme production
- **Result**: ↑ metabolism of other drugs → ↓ effectiveness
- **Example**: Rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine (induce enzymes)

**Enzyme Inhibition**:
- Some drugs block enzyme activity
- **Result**: ↓ metabolism of other drugs → ↑ levels → toxicity
- **Example**: Grapefruit juice, ketoconazole, erythromycin (inhibit enzymes)

**Clinical Implications**:
```
LIVER DISEASE:
  • Use lower doses
  • Monitor for toxicity
  • Avoid hepatotoxic drugs
  • Monitor liver function tests
```

---

### Excretion (Elimination)

**Definition**: Removal of drug from body

**Primary route**: **Kidneys** (urine)

**Other routes**:
- Lungs (exhaled gases, volatile anesthetics)
- GI tract (bile → feces)
- Sweat, saliva, breast milk

**Factors Affecting Renal Excretion**:
- **Kidney function** (GFR, creatinine clearance)
- **Urine pH**: Affects ionization and reabsorption
- **Age**: Infants (immature), elderly (decreased function)
- **Drug properties**: Lipid vs. water soluble

**Clinical Implications**:
```
RENAL DISEASE:
  • Dose adjustment (reduce dose or extend interval)
  • Monitor drug levels
  • Watch for toxicity
  • Monitor renal function (BUN, creatinine, GFR)
  • Avoid nephrotoxic drugs when possible
```

**Half-Life (t½)**:
- Time for plasma concentration to decrease by 50%
- **Short t½**: Frequent dosing needed
- **Long t½**: Less frequent dosing, longer to reach steady state
- **Steady state**: Reached after ~5 half-lives
- **Elimination**: Drug eliminated after ~5 half-lives

## 🎯 Pharmacodynamics

### Drug-Receptor Interactions

**Mechanism**: Most drugs work by binding to receptors

**Types of Drug Actions**:

| Type | Action | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Agonist** | Binds and ACTIVATES receptor | Morphine (opioid receptor agonist) |
| **Antagonist** | Binds but BLOCKS receptor | Naloxone (opioid receptor antagonist) |
| **Partial agonist** | Activates receptor but less than full agonist | Buprenorphine |
| **Competitive antagonist** | Competes with agonist (reversible) | Atropine blocks acetylcholine |
| **Non-competitive antagonist** | Binds different site (irreversible) | Aspirin |

---

### Dose-Response Relationship

**Therapeutic Range**:
```
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│   DRUG CONCENTRATION LEVELS        │
├────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Toxic level ─────────────────────┐│
│                                    ││ Toxicity
│  Therapeutic range ───────────────┤│
│                                    ││ Effective
│  Subtherapeutic level ────────────┤│
│                                    ││ Ineffective
│  No effect ───────────────────────┘│
└────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Therapeutic Index (TI)**:
- Ratio of toxic dose to therapeutic dose
- **Narrow TI** (small margin): High risk of toxicity (requires monitoring)
  - Examples: Digoxin, warfarin, lithium, theophylline, phenytoin
- **Wide TI**: Safer

**Therapeutic Drug Monitoring**:
- Measure blood levels to maintain therapeutic range
- **Peak level**: Highest concentration (assess toxicity)
- **Trough level**: Lowest concentration (just before next dose - assess adequacy)

---

### Onset, Peak, and Duration

```
DRUG ACTION TIMELINE:
  ├─ ONSET ─┤─── PEAK ───┤────── DURATION ──────┤

  Onset: Time until drug effect begins
  Peak: Time of maximum effect
  Duration: Length of drug action
```

**Clinical Application**:
- **PRN pain medication**: Give before peak pain (allow time for onset)
- **Insulin**: Know onset/peak/duration to coordinate with meals
- **Antihypertensives**: Check BP at peak action

---

### Therapeutic Effects vs. Side Effects

**Therapeutic Effect**: Desired, intended effect

**Side Effects**: Unintended effects (predictable, dose-related)

**Adverse Effects**: Harmful, unintended effects (more severe than side effects)

**Toxic Effects**: Serious effects from excessive dose or accumulation

**Allergic Reactions**: Immune-mediated response
- Mild: Rash, itching
- Severe: Anaphylaxis (life-threatening)

**Idiosyncratic Reaction**: Unexpected, unusual response (unpredictable)

## 👶👴 Special Populations

### Pediatrics

**Differences**:
```
PEDIATRIC CONSIDERATIONS:
  • Immature liver/kidney function (slower metabolism/excretion)
  • Different body composition (more water, less fat)
  • Developing nervous system
  • Cannot always report side effects
  • Weight-based dosing (mg/kg or mg/m²)
  • ALWAYS verify safe dose range
  • Use age-appropriate formulations
```

**Dosing**:
- Based on weight (kg) or body surface area (m²)
- Use oral syringe (not household spoon)
- Never estimate weight - always measure
- Verify calculations (independent double-check)

---

### Geriatrics

**Physiological Changes**:
```
AGING EFFECTS ON PHARMACOLOGY:
  Absorption:
    • ↓ GI motility (delayed absorption)
    • ↓ gastric acid

  Distribution:
    • ↓ lean body mass, ↑ body fat
    • ↓ serum albumin (↑ free drug)
    • ↓ body water

  Metabolism:
    • ↓ liver mass and blood flow
    • ↓ enzyme activity

  Excretion:
    • ↓ kidney function (GFR)
    • ↓ drug clearance
```

**Clinical Implications**:
- **Start low, go slow** (lower initial doses)
- Increased sensitivity to drugs
- ↑ risk of adverse effects and toxicity
- ↑ risk of drug interactions (polypharmacy)
- Monitor kidney/liver function
- Simplify regimen (improve adherence)

**Beers Criteria**: List of potentially inappropriate medications for older adults
- Anticholinergics (confusion, falls, urinary retention)
- Benzodiazepines (falls, cognitive impairment)
- First-generation antihistamines (sedation, anticholinergic effects)

---

### Pregnancy

**FDA Pregnancy Categories** (older system):
- **A**: Controlled studies show no risk
- **B**: No evidence of risk (animal studies safe, no human studies)
- **C**: Risk cannot be ruled out (animal studies show risk, no human studies)
- **D**: Positive evidence of risk (may use if benefits outweigh risks)
- **X**: Contraindicated (risks outweigh any possible benefit)

**New System** (since 2015):
- Narrative summary of risks
- Clinical considerations
- Data supporting the summary

**Critical Periods**:
- **First trimester**: Organogenesis (greatest risk for birth defects)
- **Third trimester**: Drugs may affect labor, delivery, or newborn

**Lactation**: Many drugs pass into breast milk
- Lipid-soluble drugs cross more easily
- Consider timing of dose (after breastfeeding)

---

### Hepatic Impairment

**Implications**:
- ↓ drug metabolism → ↑ drug levels → toxicity
- ↓ albumin production → ↑ free drug
- Altered blood flow

**Management**:
- Dose reduction
- Avoid hepatotoxic drugs
- Monitor liver function tests (AST, ALT, bilirubin, albumin)
- Monitor for signs of toxicity

---

## ✅ Practice Questions

<details>
<summary>1. Which statement about pharmacokinetics is correct?</summary>

**Answer**: The liver is the primary site of drug metabolism

**Rationale**: Metabolism (biotransformation) occurs primarily in the liver through Phase I and Phase II reactions. The liver metabolizes most drugs to inactive metabolites for excretion. This is part of the "M" in ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion).
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Patient with liver cirrhosis is prescribed a medication. What is the PRIORITY nursing consideration?</summary>

**Answer**: The patient may require a lower dose due to decreased drug metabolism

**Rationale**: Liver disease decreases drug metabolism, leading to increased drug levels and toxicity risk. Patients with hepatic impairment typically need reduced doses. The nurse should monitor closely for signs of toxicity.
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Which drug requires monitoring of peak and trough levels?</summary>

**Answer**: Gentamicin (aminoglycoside antibiotic)

**Rationale**: Aminoglycosides have a narrow therapeutic index and can cause nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. Peak and trough levels are monitored to ensure therapeutic levels while avoiding toxicity. Trough level is drawn just before next dose.
</details>

<details>
<summary>4. Patient is prescribed a medication with a narrow therapeutic index. What does this mean?</summary>

**Answer**: There is a small difference between therapeutic and toxic doses

**Rationale**: Narrow therapeutic index means the margin between effective dose and toxic dose is small. These drugs (digoxin, warfarin, lithium, theophylline) require careful monitoring to maintain therapeutic levels and avoid toxicity.
</details>

<details>
<summary>5. Older adult patient asks why the doctor prescribed a lower dose than usual. What is the nurse's BEST response?</summary>

**Answer**: "As we age, our kidneys and liver don't work as efficiently, so lower doses prevent drug buildup."

**Rationale**: Aging causes decreased liver metabolism and kidney excretion, leading to increased drug levels and risk of toxicity. "Start low, go slow" is the principle for geriatric dosing. This explains the rationale in understandable terms.
</details>

<details>
<summary>6. Patient taking warfarin asks about eating leafy green vegetables. What should the nurse teach?</summary>

**Answer**: "You can eat leafy greens, but keep your intake consistent from day to day."

**Rationale**: Leafy greens are high in vitamin K, which antagonizes warfarin's anticoagulant effect. The key is consistency - don't avoid completely, but don't vary intake dramatically (affects INR stability). Sudden increases decrease warfarin effectiveness.
</details>

<details>
<summary>7. Which route of administration provides 100% bioavailability?</summary>

**Answer**: Intravenous (IV)

**Rationale**: IV route delivers medication directly into bloodstream, providing 100% bioavailability (all of the drug reaches systemic circulation). All other routes have less than 100% bioavailability due to absorption barriers and first-pass metabolism (oral).
</details>

<details>
<summary>8. Patient develops hives, wheezing, and hypotension after receiving IV antibiotic. What is the PRIORITY action?</summary>

**Answer**: Stop the infusion immediately and administer epinephrine IM

**Rationale**: These are signs of anaphylaxis (life-threatening allergic reaction). STOP the drug immediately, then give epinephrine 0.3-0.5 mg IM (first-line treatment). Then call for help, maintain airway, give oxygen, IV fluids. Antihistamines and steroids are adjunct therapy.
</details>
