#### Computed Tomography (CT Scan)

**Purpose**: Detailed cross-sectional images

**Types**:

  - Contrast is nephrotoxic
  - Hold **metformin** 48 hours before/after (lactic acidosis risk)
- **IV access** required
- Inform patient about warm/flushing sensation

**Nursing Care After**:
- **Increase fluid intake** (flush contrast through kidneys)
- Monitor for allergic reaction
- Resume metformin only after kidney function confirmed normal
- Monitor kidney function in at-risk patients

## 🎯 NCLEX Tips

### General Principles for All Diagnostic Tests

**Before the Test**:
1. **Informed consent** - invasive procedures require signed consent
2. **Allergies** - especially iodine/shellfish for contrast studies
3. **NPO status** - verify fasting requirements
4. **Baseline vital signs and assessment**
5. **Patient teaching** - explain procedure, what to expect
6. **Remove contraindicated items** (metal for MRI, jewelry for X-ray)

**After the Test**:
1. **Monitor vital signs** - especially after invasive procedures
2. **Assess for complications** - bleeding, infection, perforation
3. **Site care** - if puncture/incision
4. **Activity restrictions** - bedrest, limitations
5. **Resume diet/medications** - when appropriate

### High-Yield NCLEX Points

1. **NPO for sedation** = 6-8 hours
2. **Gag reflex must return** before eating/drinking after throat procedures
3. **Check kidney function** before contrast studies
4. **Hold metformin** 48 hours before/after contrast
5. **Increase fluids** after contrast (flush through kidneys)
6. **Mark pulses** before cardiac cath (compare after)
7. **Position on right side** after liver biopsy (tamponade bleeding)
8. **Flat in bed** after lumbar puncture (prevent headache)
9. **Quality bowel prep** = quality colonoscopy
10. **Informed consent required** for invasive procedures

### Priority Complications

**Report immediately**:
- **Pneumothorax**: After thoracentesis, bronchoscopy, lung biopsy
- **Bleeding**: After liver biopsy, cardiac cath, bone marrow biopsy
- **Perforation**: After colonoscopy, endoscopy
- **Allergic reaction**: After contrast administration
- **Cardiac events**: After stress test, cardiac cath

## 📝 Practice Questions

<details>
<summary>Question 1: A patient is scheduled for an MRI. Which finding requires intervention before the test?</summary>

**Answer**: Patient has a pacemaker

**Rationale**: Pacemakers are an ABSOLUTE contraindication to MRI due to the strong magnetic field. The magnet can cause pacemaker malfunction. Other metal implants need to be verified for MRI compatibility. Always screen for metal before MRI.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 2: After a liver biopsy, in which position should the patient be placed?</summary>

**Answer**: Right side-lying position

**Rationale**: Positioning on the right side applies pressure to the biopsy site and helps prevent bleeding. Patient should remain in this position for 2-4 hours, then bedrest for 24 hours. Monitor for bleeding (hypotension, tachycardia, abdominal/shoulder pain).
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 3: A patient returns from cardiac catheterization via right femoral artery. What is the priority assessment?</summary>

**Answer**: Check right pedal pulse and compare to left

**Rationale**: After cardiac cath, priority is monitoring neurovascular status distal to insertion site. Check pedal pulses (should have been marked pre-procedure), color, temperature, sensation, movement. Decreased or absent pulse indicates arterial occlusion - a medical emergency.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 4: When can a patient eat after a bronchoscopy?</summary>

**Answer**: After the gag reflex returns (2-4 hours)

**Rationale**: The throat is anesthetized during bronchoscopy. Patient must remain NPO until gag reflex returns to prevent aspiration. Test gag reflex before offering food or fluids. This applies to ANY procedure involving throat anesthesia (EGD, TEE, bronchoscopy).
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 5: A patient taking metformin is scheduled for a CT scan with contrast. What should the nurse do?</summary>

**Answer**: Hold metformin 48 hours before and after the procedure

**Rationale**: Metformin combined with IV contrast can cause lactic acidosis. Hold metformin 48 hours before and 48 hours after contrast administration. Resume only after kidney function (creatinine) is verified as normal. Also ensure adequate hydration.
</details>
