## 🚶 Normal Mobility & Movement

### Types of Movement

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Active ROM** | Patient moves joint independently | Patient lifts own arm overhead |
| **Passive ROM** | Nurse/therapist moves joint for patient | Nurse moves unconscious patient's limbs |
| **Active-Assisted ROM** | Patient initiates, nurse assists | Patient starts arm lift, nurse helps complete motion |
| **Resistive ROM** | Movement against resistance | Weight training, resistance bands |

### Factors Affecting Mobility

```
FACTORS INFLUENCING MOBILITY:
  • Musculoskeletal: Bones, muscles, joints, tendons, ligaments
  • Neurological: CNS coordination, balance, motor control
  • Cardiovascular: Adequate perfusion to muscles
  • Respiratory: Oxygen supply for muscle function
  • Pain: Limits willingness to move
  • Energy: Fatigue, weakness, illness
  • Psychological: Depression, motivation, fear of falling
  • Developmental: Age-related changes
  • Medications: Sedatives, muscle relaxants
```

## ⚠️ Hazards of Immobility

### Cardiovascular System

**Effects**:
- **Orthostatic hypotension**: Blood pools in extremities when upright
- **Increased cardiac workload**: 10-15% increase
- **Venous stasis**: Slowed blood flow
- **Thrombus formation**: DVT risk
- **Decreased cardiac reserve**

**Prevention**:
- Early mobilization
- ROM exercises
- Sequential compression devices (SCDs)
- Anticoagulation therapy (if ordered)
- Change position frequently
- Gradual position changes (dangle before standing)

---

### Respiratory System

**Effects**:
- **Decreased lung expansion**: Shallow breathing
- **Pooling of secretions**: Especially in dependent areas
- **Hypostatic pneumonia**: Inflammation from stagnant secretions
- **Decreased cough reflex**
- **Atelectasis**: Alveolar collapse

**Prevention**:
```
RESPIRATORY INTERVENTIONS:
  ✓ Turn, cough, deep breathe every 2 hours
  ✓ Incentive spirometry every 1-2 hours while awake
  ✓ Position changes (prevents pooling in one area)
  ✓ HOB elevated (promotes lung expansion)
  ✓ Early ambulation
  ✓ Adequate hydration (thins secretions)
  ✓ Chest physiotherapy if needed
```

**Mnemonic - Respiratory complications: "CHAPS"**:
- **C**ough (decreased)
- **H**ypostatic pneumonia
- **A**telectasis
- **P**ooled secretions
- **S**hallow respirations

---

### Musculoskeletal System

**Effects**:
- **Muscle atrophy**: 1-3% muscle mass lost per day
- **Decreased muscle strength**: 10-15% per week
- **Contractures**: Permanent muscle shortening

- **Osteoporosis**: Bone demineralization
- **Fracture risk**: Decreased bone density

**Prevention**:
- **Active/passive ROM** exercises at least 2-3 times daily
- **Resistive exercises** when able
- **Proper positioning**: Maintain functional alignment
- **Weight-bearing activities** as soon as possible
- **Adequate protein** and **calcium/vitamin D** intake

**Contracture Prevention**:

| **Stage 3** | Full-thickness skin loss | Deep crater, subcutaneous fat visible |
| **Stage 4** | Full-thickness tissue loss | Muscle, bone, tendon exposed |
| **Unstageable** | Full-thickness loss, depth unknown | Covered by slough/eschar |
| **Deep Tissue Injury** | Persistent non-blanchable deep red, maroon, or purple | Intact or non-intact skin |

**High-Risk Areas**:
```
PRESSURE POINTS:
  Supine: Occiput, scapulae, sacrum, coccyx, heels
  Side-lying: Ears, shoulders, ribs, greater trochanter, knees, ankles

### Crutches

**Types**:
- **Axillary crutches**: Most common, underarm support
- **Forearm (Lofstrand) crutches**: Cuff around forearm
- **Platform crutches**: For arthritis, weak grip

**Fitting (Axillary)**:
- **Standing**: 2-3 finger widths between axilla and crutch top (prevents brachial plexus injury)
- **Hand grips**: Elbow flexed 15-30°, wrist extended
- **Length**: From axilla to 6 inches lateral to foot

**Crutch Gaits**:

| Gait | Weight-Bearing | Pattern |
|------|---------------|---------|

1. Position chair at **45° angle to bed** on patient's **stronger side**
2. Lock wheelchair brakes, remove/swing away footrests
3. Raise HOB, assist to sitting (dangle)
4. Assess for dizziness/orthostatic hypotension
5. Apply gait belt
6. Stand patient (on count of 3, patient pushes up)
7. Pivot toward stronger leg
8. Lower into chair (bend knees, patient reaches for armrests)

**Key Points**:
- Transfer toward **stronger side**
- Allow patient to help as much as able
- Protect weaker side
- Gait belt for safety

---

### Dangling (Sitting on Edge of Bed)

## ✅ Practice Questions

<details>
<summary>1. Patient is using a cane. Which observation indicates correct use?</summary>

**Answer**: Patient holds the cane on the stronger side and moves the weaker leg forward with the cane

**Rationale**: Cane should be held on the stronger side to provide support for the weaker side. When walking, move the cane and weak leg together, then the strong leg. This provides maximum support and stability.
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. What is the PRIORITY intervention to prevent complications of immobility in a bedridden patient?</summary>

**Answer**: Reposition the patient every 2 hours

**Rationale**: Repositioning every 2 hours prevents pressure injuries (most common complication) and also helps prevent respiratory complications, contractures, and circulatory problems. This is the most comprehensive intervention.
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Patient is learning crutch walking after ankle surgery (non-weight-bearing). Which gait should the nurse teach?</summary>

**Answer**: Three-point gait

**Rationale**: Three-point gait is used when one leg cannot bear weight. Both crutches and the affected leg move forward together, then the unaffected leg follows. This prevents weight on the injured ankle.
</details>

<details>
<summary>4. Which position is BEST for a patient with dyspnea?</summary>

**Answer**: High Fowler's position (80-90 degrees)

**Rationale**: High Fowler's position promotes maximum lung expansion and eases breathing by using gravity to pull abdominal contents away from the diaphragm. This is the best position for patients with respiratory distress.
</details>

<details>
<summary>5. Nurse is positioning a patient in Sims' position. Where should the nurse place the patient?</summary>

**Answer**: On the side with the lower arm behind the back and the upper leg flexed

**Rationale**: Sims' is a semi-prone position: on side, lower arm behind back, upper arm flexed forward on pillow, upper leg flexed more than lower leg. Used for rectal exams, enemas, and drainage in unconscious patients.
</details>

<details>
<summary>6. Patient with right-sided weakness is transferring from bed to wheelchair. Where should the nurse place the wheelchair?</summary>

**Answer**: On the patient's left side (stronger side)

**Rationale**: Wheelchair should be positioned on the patient's stronger side. This allows the patient to use the stronger side for support during transfer and lead with the stronger leg. Transfer toward strength.
</details>

<details>
<summary>7. Which action by the nurse prevents foot drop in an immobilized patient?</summary>

**Answer**: Apply high-top sneakers and ensure feet are supported in dorsiflexion

**Rationale**: Foot drop (plantar flexion contracture) is prevented by maintaining the foot in dorsiflexion using footboards, high-top sneakers, or splints. This keeps the ankle at 90 degrees.
</details>

<details>
<summary>8. Patient is going up stairs with crutches. What should the nurse teach?</summary>

**Answer**: "Move your unaffected leg up first, then the crutches and affected leg."

**Rationale**: When going up stairs: "Up with the good" - good leg goes up first, then crutches and bad leg follow. When going down: "Down with the bad" - crutches and bad leg go down first, then good leg. Mnemonic: "Up with good, down with bad."
