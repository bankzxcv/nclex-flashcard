**Prevention** (Most Important):
1. **Incentive spirometry** - 10 times every hour while awake
2. **Deep breathing and coughing** exercises
3. **Early ambulation**
4. **Turn, cough, deep breathe** every 2 hours
5. **Adequate pain control** (enables deep breathing)
6. **Semi-Fowler's or high Fowler's position**
7. **Splint surgical site** when coughing

**Treatment**:

## 📝 Practice Questions

<details>
<summary>Question 1: A patient 2 days post-op abdominal surgery suddenly reports "something gave way." The nurse notes serosanguineous drainage on the dressing. What is the priority action?</summary>

**Answer**: Place patient in low Fowler's position with knees flexed and cover wound with sterile saline-soaked gauze.

**Rationale**: This indicates wound dehiscence (separation of wound edges). Low Fowler's with flexed knees reduces tension on the wound. Cover with sterile saline-soaked gauze to keep moist. Notify surgeon immediately. Patient will likely need to return to OR. Do NOT remove dressing or attempt to approximate edges.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 2: A post-op patient develops sudden dyspnea, chest pain, and tachycardia on day 7. What does the nurse suspect?</summary>

**Answer**: Pulmonary embolism (PE)

**Rationale**: Classic triad: sudden dyspnea, chest pain, hemoptysis. Timing (7 days post-op) is consistent with PE. This is a medical emergency. Immediate actions: High Fowler's position, administer oxygen, call Rapid Response, IV access. Prepare for anticoagulation and diagnostic tests (CT angiography, D-dimer).
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 3: What is the MOST important intervention to prevent atelectasis?</summary>

**Answer**: Incentive spirometry 10 times every hour while awake

**Rationale**: Atelectasis is the most common post-op respiratory complication. Incentive spirometry promotes deep breathing and lung expansion, preventing alveolar collapse. Other important measures: early ambulation, turn/cough/deep breathe every 2 hours, adequate pain control (enables deep breathing).
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 4: A patient with organs protruding through a surgical wound. What is the FIRST action?</summary>

**Answer**: Cover with sterile saline-soaked gauze and stay with patient

**Rationale**: This is evisceration - a medical emergency. NEVER attempt to replace organs. Cover with sterile saline-soaked gauze to keep organs moist. Place patient in low Fowler's with knees flexed (reduces tension). Call for help, notify surgeon STAT, NPO, monitor VS. Patient needs emergency surgery.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 5: A patient has absent bowel sounds and abdominal distention on day 2 post-op abdominal surgery. What should the nurse do?</summary>

**Answer**: Keep patient NPO, encourage ambulation, and notify provider

**Rationale**: This indicates paralytic ileus (temporary cessation of peristalsis). Common after abdominal surgery. Interventions: NPO until bowel sounds return, ambulation (stimulates peristalsis), IV fluids, possibly NG tube for decompression. Auscultate all 4 quadrants for 5 full minutes before documenting absent bowel sounds.
