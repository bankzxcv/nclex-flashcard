## 🛁 Principles of Hygiene Care

### Importance of Hygiene

**Benefits**:
```
HYGIENE PROMOTES:
  • Skin integrity (removes bacteria, dead cells, secretions)
  • Comfort and relaxation
  • Circulation (from massage, warm water)
  • Self-esteem and dignity
  • Opportunity for assessment
  • Therapeutic nurse-patient relationship
  • Prevention of infection
  • Odor control
```

### Cultural Considerations

**Respect for**:
- Bathing preferences and frequency
- Modesty (provide privacy, same-gender care if preferred)
- Religious practices (ritual bathing, head covering)
- Hair care practices
- Gender roles in care

**Always ask patient about preferences!**

## 🚿 Bathing

### Types of Baths

| Type | Description | When Used |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Complete bed bath** | Nurse bathes patient in bed | Totally dependent, unconscious, severely limited mobility |
| **Partial bed bath** | Patient bathes accessible areas, nurse bathes back/perineum/feet | Limited mobility, weakness, dyspnea |
| **Assist bath** | Patient bathes self with minimal help | Needs help with hard-to-reach areas |
| **Self-bath** | Patient bathes independently | Independent, may need setup |
| **Shower/tub** | Standing shower or tub bath | Mobile patients, with assist if needed |

### Complete Bed Bath Procedure

**Supplies**:
- Basin with warm water (110-115°F / 43-46°C)
- Soap, washcloths, towels
- Clean gown/clothes
- Clean linens
- Laundry bag
- Lotion

**Procedure**:
```
BED BATH SEQUENCE (head to toe, clean to dirty):
  1. FACE
     • No soap (unless patient requests)
     • Eyes: inner to outer canthus
     • Use different corner of cloth for each eye
     • Ears and neck

  2. ARMS
     • Far arm first (less reaching over patient)
     • Long strokes from wrist to shoulder
     • Axilla
     • Hand soak in basin if desired

  3. CHEST AND ABDOMEN
     • Expose only area being washed (privacy, warmth)
     • Female: Wash under breasts, dry thoroughly
     • Umbilicus

  4. LEGS AND FEET
     • Far leg first
     • Long strokes from ankle to thigh
     • Foot soak in basin
     • Between toes, dry thoroughly

  5. BACK
     • Position side-lying or sitting up
     • Wash and massage back (promotes circulation)
     • Inspect skin

  6. PERINEAL CARE
     • Change water and washcloth
     • Provide privacy
     • Front to back (prevent contamination)
```

**Important Points**:
- **Never** leave unconscious/confused patient alone with water
- **Change water** when cool, soapy, or dirty
- **Pat dry** (don't rub) - prevents skin damage
- **Observe skin** throughout (redness, breakdown, rashes)
- **Maintain privacy** - expose only area being washed
- **Encourage participation** - promotes independence

---

### Perineal Care (Peri-Care)

**When Needed**:
- Daily (with bath)
- After bowel movement/urination
- With indwelling catheter (daily)
- Before procedures (catheterization, vaginal exam)

**Female Perineal Care**:
```
FEMALE PERI-CARE:
  1. Position supine with knees flexed, separated
  2. Drape for privacy
  3. Use washcloth or peri-wipes
  4. Separate labia
  5. Clean FRONT TO BACK (one stroke per wipe)
     • Center (over urethra)
     • Each side of labia
     • Outer labia
  6. Dry front to back
  7. Clean anal area last (separate cloth)
```

**Male Perineal Care**:
```
MALE PERI-CARE:
  1. Gently retract foreskin (if uncircumcised)
  2. Clean glans in circular motion
  3. Clean shaft
  4. Replace foreskin (prevent paraphimosis)
  5. Clean scrotum
  6. Clean anal area last (separate cloth)
```

**Key Points**:
- **ALWAYS front to back** (women) - prevents UTI
- **Replace foreskin** (uncircumcised males) - prevents paraphimosis
- **Never force** foreskin if adhered
- **Observe** for discharge, redness, odor, lesions

---

### Bathing Special Populations

#### Older Adults

**Considerations**:
- **Fragile skin** - use gentle soap, avoid hot water
- **Dry skin** - moisturize immediately after bathing
- **Falls risk** - shower chair, grab bars, non-slip mat
- **Temperature sensitivity** - avoid chilling
- **May not need daily bath** (dries skin) - partial bath on alternate days acceptable

#### Patients with Dementia

**Strategies**:
- Maintain routine
- Simple instructions
- Calm environment (reduce stimuli)
- Privacy, dignity
- Warm room/water
- Distraction techniques
- May need reassurance throughout
- Avoid arguing

---

## 🦷 Oral Care

### Importance

**Oral hygiene prevents**:
- Dental caries, periodontal disease
- Pneumonia (especially ventilated patients)
- Discomfort, pain
- Halitosis (bad breath)
- Altered taste
- Poor nutrition (painful to eat)

### Oral Care for Conscious Patients

**Procedure**:
1. Position upright or side-lying (prevent aspiration)
2. Brush teeth with soft toothbrush and toothpaste
   - All surfaces (outer, inner, chewing)
   - Tongue
   - Gums
3. Floss between teeth
4. Rinse mouth
5. Apply lip balm if dry

**Frequency**: After meals and at bedtime (minimum 2×/day)

---

### Oral Care for Unconscious Patients

**Special Considerations**:
- **High aspiration risk** - position side-lying
- **No cough/gag reflex** - never give water to rinse/drink
- **Mouth breathing** - dries mucous membranes

**Procedure**:
```
UNCONSCIOUS PATIENT ORAL CARE:
  1. Position side-lying, HOB elevated
  2. Use suction catheter (Yankauer)
  3. Use foam swabs or soft toothbrush
  4. Moisten with water or mouthwash
  5. Clean all surfaces gently
  6. Suction frequently (prevent aspiration)
  7. Apply mouth moisturizer/lubricant
  8. Reposition every 2 hours (prevent pooling in one area)
```

**Frequency**: Every 2 hours and PRN

**Never**: Force mouth open, use lemon-glycerin swabs (drying), use toothpicks

---

### Denture Care

**Procedure**:
1. Remove dentures (use gauze for grip)
2. Rinse under running water
3. Brush with denture cleaner or toothpaste
4. Rinse thoroughly
5. Store in denture cup with water or cleansing solution (prevents warping)
6. Clean patient's gums and tongue
7. Reinsert or leave out per patient preference

**Important**:
- **Handle over basin of water** (prevents breaking if dropped)
- **Never wrap in tissue** (often discarded accidentally)
- **Label denture cup** with patient name
- Remove at night (allows gums to rest) unless patient prefers to wear

---

## 💇 Hair Care

### Hair and Scalp Care

**Daily care**:
- Brush or comb daily (stimulates circulation, distributes oils)
- Use wide-tooth comb for curly/textured hair
- Be gentle (avoid pulling)
- Part hair differently each day (reduces pressure)

**Shampooing**:
- Weekly or per patient preference
- More frequent if needed (oily hair, diaphoresis)
- Use dry shampoo if can't use water

**Shampooing in Bed**:
1. Use shampoo tray or basin
2. Position patient supine, head at edge of bed
3. Place waterproof pad under head
4. Tray drains into basin/bucket
5. Wet hair with pitcher
6. Shampoo, rinse thoroughly
7. Dry with towel, style

**Cultural Considerations**:
- African American hair: May need special products, less frequent washing
- Some cultures: Head is sacred, only patient or family touches hair
- Religious practices: Head covering requirements
- **Always ask patient/family about preferences and practices**

---

### Shaving

**Facial Shaving (Men)**:

| Method | Procedure | Considerations |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **Safety razor** | Soften beard with warm cloth, apply shaving cream, shave with grain, rinse | Avoid if on anticoagulants (bleeding risk) |
| **Electric razor** | Shave against grain for closer shave | Safer for anticoagulated patients |

**Important**:
- **Never use safety razor** on patients with bleeding risk (anticoagulants, low platelets)
- Respect cultural/religious practices (some don't shave beards)
- Ask about patient preferences

---

## 👣 Foot and Nail Care

### Foot Care

**Importance**:
- Prevents infection, odor
- Maintains mobility
- Especially important for diabetics (impaired healing, neuropathy)

**Procedure**:
1. Soak feet in warm water (softens skin/nails)
2. Wash with soap
3. Rinse and dry thoroughly (especially between toes)
4. Inspect for redness, cracks, lesions, odor
5. Moisturize (not between toes - maceration)
6. Clean socks

**Diabetic Foot Care**:
```
DIABETIC FOOT CARE:
  DO:
    ✓ Inspect feet DAILY
    ✓ Wash daily with lukewarm water
    ✓ Dry thoroughly (especially between toes)
    ✓ Moisturize (not between toes)
    ✓ Wear clean, dry socks
    ✓ Properly fitting shoes (no pressure points)
    ✓ Never walk barefoot

  DON'T:
    ✗ Soak feet (maceration)
    ✗ Use heating pads on feet (burn risk with neuropathy)
    ✗ Cut own toenails if poor vision/circulation (podiatrist)
    ✗ Use sharp objects on calluses
    ✗ Wear tight socks/shoes
```

**Report immediately**: Cuts, blisters, redness, swelling, warmth, odor, discharge

---

### Nail Care

**Fingernails**:
- Trim straight across
- File smooth (prevent scratching)
- Push back cuticles gently (don't cut)
- Keep clean

**Toenails**:
- Trim straight across (prevents ingrown nails)
- Don't cut too short
- File edges smooth

**Contraindications for nurses cutting nails**:
- **Diabetes** (podiatrist only)
- **Peripheral vascular disease**
- **Bleeding disorders**
- **Thick, brittle nails** (fungal infection)

## 🛏️ Skin Integrity & Pressure Injuries

### Skin Assessment

**Normal skin**:
- Intact, no breaks
- Warm, dry
- Good turgor (elasticity)
- Pink/appropriate color for ethnicity
- No lesions, rashes, redness

**Risk Factors for Breakdown**:
```
PRESSURE INJURY RISK FACTORS:
  • Immobility (bedbound, chairbound)
  • Moisture (incontinence, diaphoresis)
  • Friction and shear
  • Poor nutrition (low protein, dehydration)
  • Altered sensation (spinal cord injury, diabetes)
  • Advanced age (fragile skin)
  • Chronic illness
  • Low blood pressure (poor perfusion)
  • Edema
```

### Braden Scale

**Risk assessment tool** - Score 6-23:
- **19-23**: No risk
- **15-18**: Low risk
- **13-14**: Moderate risk
- **10-12**: High risk
- **≤9**: Very high risk

**Assesses**:
1. Sensory perception
2. Moisture
3. Activity
4. Mobility
5. Nutrition
6. Friction and shear

**Use**: On admission, daily for high-risk patients, with condition changes

---

### Pressure Injury Stages

| Stage | Description | Appearance |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **Stage 1** | Non-blanchable erythema of intact skin | Red area that doesn't turn white when pressed; may be painful, warm/cool |
| **Stage 2** | Partial-thickness skin loss | Shallow open ulcer, pink wound bed; or intact/ruptured blister |
| **Stage 3** | Full-thickness skin loss | Deep crater; subcutaneous fat visible; may have undermining/tunneling |
| **Stage 4** | Full-thickness tissue loss | Exposed muscle, bone, or tendon; often undermining/tunneling |
| **Unstageable** | Depth unknown | Full-thickness loss obscured by slough or eschar |
| **Deep Tissue Injury** | Suspected deep tissue damage | Purple/maroon discolored intact skin or blood-filled blister |

**Important**:
- **Cannot reverse stage** (Stage 4 healing is "healing Stage 4" not "now Stage 2")
- **Stages describe depth of tissue loss**, not severity of damage

---

### Pressure Injury Prevention

**Key Interventions**: "PRESSURE"

```
P - POSITION CHANGES (every 2 hours)
R - REDUCE friction and shear
E - EVALUATE skin daily
S - SUPPORT SURFACES (pressure-reducing mattress)
S - SKIN CARE (keep clean and dry)
U - UNLOAD pressure (heel protectors, padding)
R - RISK ASSESSMENT (Braden Scale)
E - EDUCATION (patient/family)
```

**Detailed Interventions**:

#### Repositioning
- **Every 2 hours** minimum
- **30-degree lateral** position (not 90-degree side-lying)
- Avoid positioning directly on pressure injury
- Use pillows between bony prominences
- **Heels off bed** (pillow under calves)
- Document position and time

#### Skin Care
- Keep clean and dry
- Cleanse with mild soap and water after incontinence
- Apply moisture barrier cream
- Moisturize dry skin
- No massage over bony prominences (causes deep tissue damage)
- Pat dry (don't rub)

#### Support Surfaces
- **Low-air-loss mattress**: Reduces pressure, controls moisture
- **Alternating pressure mattress**: Changes pressure points
- **Foam overlay**: Basic pressure reduction
- **Specialty bed**: For multiple/severe pressure injuries

#### Reduce Friction/Shear
- Lift, don't drag
- Use lift sheet
- Keep HOB <30 degrees when possible (reduces shearing)
- Use heel protectors
- Apply protective film to fragile skin

#### Nutrition
- Adequate **protein** (tissue repair)
- **Vitamin C** (collagen synthesis)
- **Zinc** (wound healing)
- **Hydration** (maintain tissue perfusion)
- Nutritional consult if malnourished

### Pressure Injury Treatment

**General principles**:
```
WOUND CARE BASICS:
  1. Relieve pressure (position off wound)
  2. Assess wound (size, depth, drainage, odor, tissue type)
  3. Clean wound (normal saline, gentle irrigation)
  4. Debride if needed (remove dead tissue)
  5. Apply appropriate dressing
  6. Manage moisture (absorb excess, maintain moist environment)
  7. Prevent infection
  8. Optimize nutrition
  9. Document thoroughly
```

**Wound Assessment - "MEASURE"**:
- **M**easurement (length, width, depth)
- **E**xudates (amount, color, odor)
- **A**ppearance (tissue type, color)
- **S**urrounding skin (intact, macerated, erythematous)
- **U**ndermining/tunneling (measure with cotton-tipped applicator)
- **R**eassessment (weekly or with changes)
- **E**valuation of pain

## 🎯 NCLEX Tips

### High-Yield Points

1. **Reposition every 2 hours** - most important prevention
2. **Heels off bed** - use pillow under calves
3. **Front to back** perineal care (women) - prevents UTI
4. **Replace foreskin** after care - prevents paraphimosis
5. **Unconscious patients**: Side-lying for oral care, suction available (aspiration risk)
6. **Diabetic feet**: Never barefoot, inspect daily, podiatrist for nail care
7. **Pressure injury staging**: Can't reverse stages
8. **Dark/purple intact skin** = deep tissue injury (suspected)
9. **No massage over bony prominences** - causes deep tissue damage
10. **Braden Scale**: Lower score = higher risk (≤9 very high risk)

### Safety Priorities

**Aspiration Prevention**:
- Unconscious patients: side-lying for oral care
- Have suction available
- Never force mouth open

**Fall Prevention**:
- Bath: Shower chair, grab bars, non-slip mat
- Lock wheels (bed, wheelchair)
- Call bell within reach

**Infection Prevention**:
- Front to back peri-care
- Clean to dirty sequence
- Hand hygiene

**Skin Integrity**:
- Reposition Q2H
- Keep skin clean and dry
- Inspect daily

### Delegation

**Can delegate to UAP** (stable patient):
- Bathing, oral care, perineal care
- Linen changes
- Repositioning
- Foot care (not diabetic, no nail cutting)

**Cannot delegate**:
- Initial assessment
- Unstable patients
- Teaching
- Wound care (except simple dressing change if trained)

## ✅ Practice Questions

<details>
<summary>1. What is the PRIORITY intervention to prevent pressure injuries in an immobile patient?</summary>

**Answer**: Reposition the patient every 2 hours

**Rationale**: Repositioning every 2 hours is the single most important intervention to prevent pressure injuries. It relieves pressure on bony prominences and allows tissue reperfusion. While other interventions (nutrition, skin care, support surfaces) are important, repositioning is the priority.
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Nurse is providing perineal care for a female patient. What is the correct technique?</summary>

**Answer**: Clean from front to back using a clean area of the cloth for each stroke

**Rationale**: Always clean front to back in females to prevent introducing bacteria from the rectal area to the urethra/vagina (prevents UTI). Use clean area of cloth for each stroke to avoid recontamination.
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. When providing oral care for an unconscious patient, what is the MOST important action?</summary>

**Answer**: Position the patient side-lying and use suction frequently

**Rationale**: Side-lying position and frequent suctioning prevent aspiration, which is the highest risk for unconscious patients during oral care. The patient has no cough/gag reflex to protect the airway.
</details>

<details>
<summary>4. Patient has a Stage 2 pressure injury on the sacrum. After treatment, the wound is now shallow with pink tissue. How should the nurse document this?</summary>

**Answer**: "Healing Stage 2 pressure injury"

**Rationale**: Pressure injuries are never "reverse staged." A healing Stage 2 remains a Stage 2 (healing) until completely closed. The stages describe tissue loss depth, not healing progression.
</details>

<details>
<summary>5. Which patient is at HIGHEST risk for developing a pressure injury?</summary>

**Answer**: Confused patient who is incontinent and bedbound

**Rationale**: This patient has multiple risk factors: immobility (bedbound), moisture (incontinence), and altered mental status (cannot reposition self or report discomfort). Multiple risk factors exponentially increase risk.
</details>

<details>
<summary>6. Nurse notes an area of intact skin that is purple and does not blanch. How should this be documented?</summary>

**Answer**: Deep tissue pressure injury

**Rationale**: Deep tissue injury presents as purple or maroon discoloration of intact skin or blood-filled blister. This indicates damage to underlying soft tissue from pressure/shear.
</details>

<details>
<summary>7. Patient with diabetes asks about foot care at home. What should the nurse teach?</summary>

**Answer**: "Inspect your feet daily and never walk barefoot."

**Rationale**: Diabetics have impaired healing and often neuropathy (can't feel injuries). Daily inspection detects problems early. Never walking barefoot prevents injuries. These are critical diabetic foot care principles.
</details>

<details>
<summary>8. When bathing a patient, the nurse should clean which area LAST?</summary>

**Answer**: Perineal area

**Rationale**: Follow clean-to-dirty principle. Perineal area is the most contaminated and should be cleaned last to prevent spreading bacteria to other body parts. Use fresh water and clean cloth for perineal care.
</details>
