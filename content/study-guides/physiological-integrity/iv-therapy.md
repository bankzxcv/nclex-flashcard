# IV Therapy & Complications

## Overview
Intravenous therapy is a critical nursing skill used to administer fluids, medications, blood products, and nutrition. Understanding IV access devices, fluid management, and recognizing/preventing complications is essential for safe patient care and frequently tested on the NCLEX.

## 💉 IV Access Devices

### Peripheral IV Catheters

**Most common** for short-term therapy (<7 days)

**Catheter Sizes** (gauge):
```
GAUGE SELECTION:
  14-16 G: Trauma, surgery, rapid transfusion (LARGE bore)
  18 G: Blood transfusions, surgery
  20 G: Most common adult size (fluids, medications)
  22 G: Older adults, fragile veins, children
  24-26 G: Neonates, very fragile veins (SMALL bore)

Remember: Smaller number = LARGER catheter
```

**Site Selection**:

**Preferred sites** (distal to proximal):
1. Hand (dorsal metacarpal veins)
2. Forearm (cephalic, basilic veins)
3. Antecubital fossa (last choice - limits mobility)

**Avoid**:
- Affected side in mastectomy, stroke, dialysis access
- Lower extremities (DVT risk, poor circulation)
- Areas of infection, infiltration, phlebitis
- Joints (limits movement, increased dislodgement)
- Underside of wrist (nerve damage risk)

**Best Practice**:
- Start distally, work proximally (preserves veins)
- Use non-dominant hand when possible
- Palpate, don't just look (feel for bounce/resilience)

---

### Central Venous Catheters (CVCs)

**Indications**:
- Long-term IV therapy (>7 days)
- Vesicant medications (chemotherapy)
- TPN (high osmolality)
- Frequent blood draws
- Poor peripheral access
- Hemodynamic monitoring

**Types**:

| Type | Description | Duration | Insertion |
|------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| **PICC** (Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter) | Inserted in arm, tip in SVC | Weeks-months | IR or bedside |
| **Tunneled (Hickman, Groshong)** | Tunneled under skin, exit on chest | Months-years | OR |
| **Implanted Port** | Subcutaneous reservoir, accessed with non-coring needle | Months-years | OR |
| **Non-tunneled (central line)** | Inserted in subclavian, jugular, femoral | Days-weeks | Bedside |

---

### PICC Lines

**Advantages**:
- Less invasive than central line
- Lower infection risk than non-tunneled CVC
- Can stay in longer than peripheral IV

**Care**:
- Measure external length (check for migration)
- Dressing change per protocol (sterile technique)
- Flush after use
- No blood pressure or blood draws on PICC arm

**Contraindications**:
- Mastectomy on same side
- AV fistula/graft on same side
- Lymphedema

---

### Implanted Ports

**Advantages**:
- No external catheter (cosmetically better)
- Lower infection risk
- Can swim, shower normally (when not accessed)
- Long-term use

**Access**:
- **Use non-coring (Huber) needle ONLY**
- Palpate port, stabilize
- Insert perpendicular to port
- Flush to verify placement
- Secure with transparent dressing

**Deaccessing**:
- Flush with saline, then heparin (per protocol)
- Remove needle while stabilizing port
- Apply pressure, bandage

## 💧 IV Fluids

### Types of IV Solutions

#### Isotonic Solutions

**Definition**: Same osmolality as blood (no fluid shift)

| Solution | Uses | Nursing Considerations |
|----------|------|----------------------|
| **0.9% Normal Saline (NS)** | Fluid resuscitation, blood transfusions, hyponatremia | Can cause hypernatremia, hyperchloremia; incompatible with some meds |
| **Lactated Ringer's (LR)** | Hypovolemia, burns, dehydration, surgery | Contains K+ (avoid in hyperkalemia, renal failure); metabolized to bicarbonate |
| **D5W** | Free water replacement, hypernatremia | *Isotonic in bag, becomes hypotonic in body* (dextrose metabolized) |

**Use**: Expand intravascular volume, replace fluid losses

---

#### Hypotonic Solutions

**Definition**: Lower osmolality than blood (fluid shifts INTO cells)

| Solution | Uses | Nursing Considerations |
|----------|------|----------------------|
| **0.45% Saline (½ NS)** | Hypernatremia, cellular dehydration | Risk of cellular swelling; monitor for cerebral edema |
| **0.33% Saline** | Hypernatremia | Similar to 0.45% NS |

**Use**: Hydrate cells, treat hypernatremia

**Caution**: Can cause cellular swelling → cerebral edema (especially if infused rapidly)

**Contraindications**:
- Increased ICP
- Burns (third-spacing risk)
- Trauma

---

#### Hypertonic Solutions

**Definition**: Higher osmolality than blood (fluid shifts OUT of cells into vascular space)

| Solution | Uses | Nursing Considerations |
|----------|------|----------------------|
| **3% Saline** | Severe hyponatremia, cerebral edema | Give slowly via pump; monitor Na+ frequently; risk of fluid overload |
| **D10W, D20W, D50W** | Hypoglycemia (D50W), TPN component | High osmolality - central line preferred |

**Use**: Expand plasma volume, reduce cerebral edema, treat severe hyponatremia

**Caution**:
- Rapid administration → circulatory overload, pulmonary edema
- Cell shrinkage, dehydration
- Monitor electrolytes closely

---

### IV Fluid Selection

**Clinical Situations**:

```
FLUID RESUSCITATION (Hypovolemia, shock):
  • 0.9% NS or LR
  • Isotonic - expands intravascular volume

DEHYDRATION:
  • 0.9% NS initially
  • Then 0.45% NS (if hypernatremic)

MAINTENANCE:
  • D5 ½ NS (most common)
  • Provides calories, sodium, free water

BLOOD TRANSFUSION:
  • 0.9% NS ONLY
  • LR contains calcium (causes clotting)
  • Never use dextrose solutions

BURN PATIENTS:
  • LR (initial resuscitation)
  • Matches electrolyte composition

HYPERNATREMIA:
  • 0.45% NS or D5W
  • Lowers sodium gradually

HYPONATREMIA (SEVERE):
  • 3% Saline
  • Central line, slow infusion, monitor closely
```

---

## 🔧 IV Administration

### Insertion Technique

**Supplies**:
- IV catheter (appropriate size)
- Tourniquet
- Antiseptic (chlorhexidine preferred)
- Gloves (clean, non-sterile)
- Transparent dressing
- Extension set/saline lock
- Flush syringe

**Procedure**:
```
IV INSERTION STEPS:
  1. Select site (distal to proximal)
  2. Apply tourniquet 4-6 inches above site
  3. Palpate vein
  4. Clean site with antiseptic (circular motion, inside out)
     • Let dry completely (30 sec)
  5. Stabilize vein (pull skin taut)
  6. Insert catheter at 10-30° angle, bevel up
  7. Watch for blood flashback
  8. Lower angle, advance catheter slightly
  9. Slide catheter off needle into vein
  10. Release tourniquet
  11. Occlude vein, remove needle
  12. Connect extension set/IV tubing
  13. Flush to verify patency
  14. Secure catheter, apply dressing
  15. Label with date, time, size, initials
```

**Safety**:
- **Never recap needle** (sharps injury risk)
- Activate safety device
- Dispose in sharps container immediately

---

### IV Site Care

**Dressing Changes**:
- **Transparent dressing**: Change every 5-7 days or when loose/soiled
- **Gauze dressing**: Change every 2 days
- Always change if damp, loose, or soiled

**Site Assessment** (every shift):
```
ASSESS FOR:
  • Patency (flushes easily, no resistance)
  • Infiltration (swelling, coolness, pain)
  • Phlebitis (redness, warmth, pain along vein)
  • Infection (redness, warmth, drainage, fever)
  • Catheter security (not pulled out)
```

**Peripheral IV Replacement**:
- **Every 72-96 hours** (per policy)
- Sooner if complications
- Rotate sites

**Flushing**:
- **Saline lock**: Flush before/after each use, every 8-12 hours if not in use
- **Technique**: "Pulsatile" (push-pause-push), end with positive pressure
- **Volume**: 3-10 mL (catheter dependent)

---

## 🚨 IV Complications

### Infiltration

**Definition**: IV fluid leaking into surrounding tissue (non-vesicant)

**Causes**:
- Catheter dislodged from vein
- Catheter punctured through vein
- Increased venous pressure

**Assessment**:
```
INFILTRATION SIGNS (6 P's):
  • Pallor (pale)
  • Puffiness/swelling at site
  • Pain/discomfort
  • Coolness (compared to opposite extremity)
  • Decreased flow rate
  • No blood return (unreliable - may still have)

SCALE (0-4):
  0: No symptoms
  1: Skin blanched, edema <1 inch, cool, mild pain
  2: Skin blanched, edema 1-6 inches, cool, moderate pain
  3: Skin blanched/translucent, edema >6 inches, cool, moderate-severe pain
  4: Skin tight/translucent, skin discolored/bruised, edema >6 inches, deep pitting, circulatory impairment
```

**Interventions**:
1. **STOP infusion immediately**
2. Disconnect IV tubing, leave catheter in place
3. Aspirate fluid if possible
4. Remove catheter
5. Elevate extremity
6. Apply **warm** compress (promotes absorption)
7. Restart IV in different site (opposite extremity if possible)
8. Document

---

### Extravasation

**Definition**: **Vesicant** medication/solution leaking into tissue

**Vesicants** (cause tissue necrosis):
- Chemotherapy (doxorubicin, vincristine, etc.)
- Vasopressors (dopamine, norepinephrine)
- Concentrated potassium, calcium
- TPN
- Contrast dye

**Assessment**:
- Similar to infiltration
- **More severe**: Burning pain, blistering, tissue necrosis

**Interventions**:
1. **STOP infusion IMMEDIATELY**
2. **DO NOT REMOVE catheter yet**
3. **DO NOT FLUSH** (spreads vesicant)
4. Attempt to aspirate drug from catheter
5. Administer **antidote** if available (through catheter, then SubQ around site):
   - Hyaluronidase (for vasopressors, vinca alkaloids)
   - Sodium thiosulfate (for mechlorethamine)
   - Phentolamine (for dopamine, norepinephrine)
6. Remove catheter
7. Apply cold compress (chemotherapy) or warm compress (vasopressors) per protocol
8. Elevate extremity
9. Notify provider immediately
10. Document, photograph if possible

**Prevention**:
- Use central line for vesicants when possible
- Frequent assessment
- Teach patient to report burning/pain immediately

---

### Phlebitis

**Definition**: Inflammation of vein

**Types**:
- **Mechanical**: Catheter irritation (too large, movement)
- **Chemical**: Irritating solution/medication (pH, osmolality)
- **Bacterial**: Infection

**Assessment**:
```
PHLEBITIS SCALE (0-4):
  0: No symptoms
  1: Erythema at site ± pain
  2: Pain + erythema ± edema
  3: Pain + erythema + edema + streak formation (palpable venous cord)
  4: Pain + erythema + streak >1 inch + palpable venous cord >1 inch + purulent drainage
```

**Signs**:
- Redness along vein
- Warmth
- Pain, tenderness
- Palpable cord
- Edema

**Interventions**:
1. Discontinue IV
2. Remove catheter
3. Apply **warm** compress
4. Restart IV in different site (opposite extremity)
5. Elevate extremity
6. If bacterial (purulent drainage, fever):
   - Culture site if ordered
   - Notify provider
   - May need antibiotics
7. Document

**Prevention**:
- Appropriate catheter size
- Appropriate site selection
- Dilute irritating medications
- Slow infusion rate for irritating drugs
- Rotate IV sites per protocol
- Secure catheter well (prevent movement)

---

### Infection (Local or Systemic)

**Local Infection**:
- Redness, warmth, swelling at insertion site
- Purulent drainage
- Pain, tenderness

**Systemic Infection** (CLABSI - Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infection):
- Fever, chills
- Elevated WBC
- Positive blood cultures

**Interventions**:
1. Discontinue IV/central line
2. Culture catheter tip (cut 2-inch segment, send in sterile container)
3. Culture site if drainage
4. Blood cultures (if systemic)
5. Notify provider
6. Antibiotics as ordered
7. Monitor vital signs

**Prevention** (CLABSI Bundle):
```
CLABSI PREVENTION:
  ✓ Hand hygiene before/after accessing line
  ✓ Strict aseptic technique during insertion
  ✓ Chlorhexidine skin prep (preferred)
  ✓ Maximal sterile barriers during insertion
  ✓ Optimal catheter site selection (avoid femoral)
  ✓ Daily assessment of line necessity
  ✓ Remove when no longer needed
  ✓ Dressing changes per protocol
  ✓ "Scrub the hub" 15 seconds before accessing
  ✓ Disinfect caps/ports before use
  ✓ Date tubing changes
```

### Air Embolism

**Definition**: Air enters bloodstream

**Risk Factors**:
- Central line disconnection
- Tubing change
- Infusion bag runs dry
- Improper priming

**Assessment**:
```
AIR EMBOLISM SIGNS:
  • Sudden dyspnea, chest pain
  • Hypotension, tachycardia
  • Cyanosis
  • Altered mental status
  • "Mill wheel" murmur (churning sound)
  • Cardiac arrest (large air embolus)
```

**Interventions**:
1. Clamp tubing immediately
2. Position patient **LEFT side-lying Trendelenburg**
   - Traps air in right atrium, prevents entry to pulmonary artery
3. Administer 100% oxygen
4. Notify provider immediately
5. Monitor vital signs, oxygen saturation
6. CPR if needed

**Prevention**:
- Prime all tubing before connecting
- Secure all connections
- Use Luer-lock connections
- Clamp catheter when changing caps/tubing
- Position patient flat for central line insertions/removal
- Have patient hold breath (Valsalva) during tubing changes on CVCs

---

### Fluid Overload

**Definition**: Excessive IV fluids → circulatory overload

**Risk Factors**:
- Rapid infusion
- Heart failure, renal failure
- Older adults, infants
- Large volumes

**Assessment**:
```
FLUID OVERLOAD SIGNS:
  Respiratory:
    • Dyspnea, tachypnea
    • Crackles in lungs
    • Pulmonary edema

  Cardiovascular:
    • Hypertension, bounding pulse
    • Jugular venous distention (JVD)
    • S3 heart sound

  Other:
    • Weight gain
    • Peripheral edema
    • Decreased oxygen saturation
```

**Interventions**:
1. **Slow or stop infusion**
2. Elevate head of bed
3. Administer oxygen
4. Notify provider
5. Anticipate diuretics
6. Monitor vital signs, I&O, daily weights
7. Restrict fluids

**Prevention**:
- Use infusion pump (precise control)
- Monitor infusion rate closely
- Monitor I&O, daily weights
- Assess lung sounds regularly
- High-risk patients: slower rates, smaller volumes

---

### Speed Shock

**Definition**: Systemic reaction to rapid IV medication administration

**Causes**: Medication pushed too quickly

**Assessment**:
- Flushing
- Headache, dizziness
- Chest tightness
- Hypotension, shock
- Cardiac arrest

**Interventions**:
1. Stop medication immediately
2. Maintain IV access (patent with NS)
3. Notify provider
4. Monitor vital signs continuously
5. Supportive care (oxygen, fluids, emergency medications)

**Prevention**:
- **ALWAYS verify rate** for IV push medications
- Use watch/timer
- Never rush
- Dilute per instructions

---

## 🎯 Special Considerations

### Blood Transfusion Compatibility

**IV Solution**: **0.9% Normal Saline ONLY**
- LR contains calcium (causes clotting)
- Dextrose solutions (lyse RBCs)

**Catheter Size**: 18-20 gauge (preferably 18G for rapid transfusion)

**Prime tubing** with normal saline before blood

---

### Medication Compatibility

**Incompatible with most medications**:
- Blood products
- Lipid emulsions
- Phenytoin

**Check compatibility** before mixing drugs or running through same line

**Use separate line** for incompatible medications

---

### Pediatric Considerations

**Vein selection**:
- Scalp veins (infants <9 months)
- Dorsum of hand, foot
- Forearm

**Restraints**: Use only as needed, least restrictive

**Monitoring**: Volume control device (prevent overload)

**Calculation**: Double-check weight-based dosing

**Assessment**: May not verbalize symptoms

---

## 🎯 NCLEX Tips

### High-Yield Points

1. **Infiltration → warm compress**, **Phlebitis → warm compress**, **Extravasation → cold (chemo) or warm (vasopressor)**
2. **Air embolism → left side-lying Trendelenburg** (traps air in right atrium)
3. **Blood transfusion → 0.9% NS ONLY** (never LR or dextrose)
4. **Extravasation → STOP, DON'T FLUSH, aspirate, antidote**
5. **CLABSI prevention**: Scrub hub, remove when not needed, aseptic technique
6. **Peripheral IV**: Replace every 72-96 hours
7. **Hypertonic solutions → central line preferred** (high osmolality)
8. **Gauge**: Lower number = larger catheter (14G > 24G)
9. **Fluid overload signs**: Crackles, dyspnea, JVD, bounding pulse
10. **Speed shock prevention**: Verify IV push rate, use watch/timer

### Priority Actions

**When IV complication suspected**:
1. **STOP the infusion** (or slow for assessment)
2. Assess patient
3. Intervene based on complication
4. Notify provider if indicated
5. Document

**Never**:
- Ignore patient complaints (burning, pain, swelling)
- Force flush if resistance felt
- Continue infusion if complication suspected
- Recap needles

## ✅ Practice Questions

<details>
<summary>1. Patient's IV site is swollen, cool to touch, and painful. What complication is this?</summary>

**Answer**: Infiltration

**Rationale**: Infiltration presents with swelling, coolness, pallor, and pain at the IV site. The fluid has leaked into surrounding tissue. Nurse should stop the infusion, remove the IV, elevate the extremity, and apply a warm compress. Phlebitis would be warm, red, and painful along the vein.
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. What is the PRIORITY action if air embolism is suspected?</summary>

**Answer**: Position patient in left side-lying Trendelenburg position

**Rationale**: This position traps air in the right atrium and prevents it from entering the pulmonary artery. Also clamp the line, administer oxygen, and notify provider immediately. This is a life-threatening emergency.
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Which IV solution is compatible with blood transfusions?</summary>

**Answer**: 0.9% Normal Saline

**Rationale**: ONLY normal saline (0.9% NS) is compatible with blood products. Lactated Ringer's contains calcium which causes clotting. Dextrose solutions cause hemolysis (RBC destruction). This is a critical safety point.
</details>

<details>
<summary>4. Patient has a PICC line. Where should the nurse avoid taking blood pressure?</summary>

**Answer**: The arm with the PICC line

**Rationale**: Never take blood pressure or perform venipuncture on the arm with a PICC line. The pressure can damage the catheter or cause thrombosis. Use the opposite arm.
</details>

<details>
<summary>5. Nurse notes redness, warmth, and a palpable cord along the vein above the IV site. What is this?</summary>

**Answer**: Phlebitis

**Rationale**: Phlebitis is inflammation of the vein presenting with redness, warmth, pain, and a palpable cord. Discontinue IV, apply warm compress, elevate extremity, and restart IV in different site. Document using phlebitis scale.
</details>

<details>
<summary>6. Which action is MOST important to prevent CLABSI?</summary>

**Answer**: Scrub the catheter hub for 15 seconds before accessing the line

**Rationale**: "Scrub the hub" is a critical CLABSI prevention measure. Vigorous mechanical scrubbing for at least 15 seconds with alcohol reduces bacterial contamination. Other measures include hand hygiene, aseptic technique, and removing line when no longer needed.
</details>

<details>
<summary>7. Patient receiving chemotherapy via peripheral IV reports severe burning pain at the site. What should the nurse do FIRST?</summary>

**Answer**: Stop the infusion immediately

**Rationale**: Burning pain suggests extravasation (vesicant leaking into tissue). STOP the infusion immediately to prevent further tissue damage. Do NOT remove catheter or flush - attempt to aspirate drug, then give antidote if available. This is a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention.
</details>

<details>
<summary>8. What indicates fluid overload in a patient receiving IV fluids?</summary>

**Answer**: Crackles in lungs, dyspnea, and jugular venous distention

**Rationale**: Fluid overload (circulatory overload) presents with respiratory symptoms (crackles, dyspnea from pulmonary edema), cardiovascular signs (JVD, bounding pulse, hypertension), and peripheral edema. Slow or stop the infusion, elevate HOB, give oxygen, notify provider.
</details>
