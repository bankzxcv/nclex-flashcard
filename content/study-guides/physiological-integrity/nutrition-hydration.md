## 🍎 Basic Nutritional Concepts

### Macronutrients

| Nutrient | Function | Calories per gram | Sources |
|----------|----------|-------------------|---------|
| **Carbohydrates** | Primary energy source | 4 kcal/g | Grains, fruits, vegetables, sugars |
| **Proteins** | Build/repair tissue, enzymes, hormones | 4 kcal/g | Meat, fish, eggs, dairy, legumes, nuts |
| **Fats** | Energy storage, cell membranes, vitamin absorption | 9 kcal/g | Oils, butter, nuts, avocados, fatty fish |

### Micronutrients

**Vitamins**:
- **Fat-soluble** (A, D, E, K): Stored in body, can accumulate to toxic levels
- **Water-soluble** (B complex, C): Not stored, need daily intake, excess excreted

**Minerals**:
- **Macrominerals**: Calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, potassium, chloride
- **Trace minerals**: Iron, zinc, iodine, selenium, copper

## 🍼 Enteral Nutrition

### Indications
- Functioning GI tract BUT unable to meet needs orally
- Dysphagia, stroke, head injury
- Anorexia, cancer
- Increased metabolic needs (burns, sepsis)

### Types of Feeding Tubes

| Type | Location | Use | Characteristics |
|------|----------|-----|----------------|
| **NG Tube** | Nose → Stomach | Short-term (<4 weeks) | Easy insertion, risk of aspiration |
| **Nasoduodenal/Nasojejunal** | Nose → Small intestine | Short-term, high aspiration risk | Lower aspiration risk, continuous feeding |
| **Gastrostomy (G-tube, PEG)** | Directly into stomach | Long-term (>4 weeks) | Surgically placed, lower aspiration than NG |
| **Jejunostomy (J-tube)** | Directly into jejunum | Long-term, high aspiration risk | Lowest aspiration risk, continuous feeding only |

### Feeding Administration Methods

**Continuous**:
- 24-hour infusion via pump
- Used for small bowel feedings
- Better tolerance, less aspiration risk
- Check residuals every 4-6 hours

**Intermittent (Bolus)**:
- 200-400 mL over 30-60 minutes, 4-6 times/day
- Mimics normal eating
- Used for gastric feedings only
- Check residual before each feeding

**Cyclic**:
- Continuous feeding for 8-16 hours (often overnight)
- Allows mobility during day

### Nursing Management

#### BEFORE Feeding
1. **Verify tube placement**:
   - **Best method**: X-ray confirmation (after insertion)
   - **Ongoing**: Check pH of aspirate (gastric <5, intestinal >6)
   - **NEVER rely on air insufflation method** ("whoosh test" - unreliable!)
2. **Check residual volume**:
   - Aspirate stomach contents
   - If >500 mL, hold feeding and notify provider
   - If 250-500 mL, recheck in 1 hour
   - **Return residual** to stomach (contains electrolytes/enzymes)
3. **Elevate HOB 30-45 degrees** (prevents aspiration)

#### DURING Feeding
- Use pump for continuous feedings
- Flush tube with 30 mL water before/after meds and feedings
- Give medications separately, never mixed with formula
- Crush medications (if appropriate), dissolve in water

#### AFTER Feeding
- **Keep HOB elevated 30-45 degrees for 30-60 minutes** after bolus feeding
- Flush tube with 30-50 mL water
- Cap tube
- Monitor for complications

### Complications

| Complication | Causes | Nursing Interventions |
|--------------|--------|----------------------|
| **Aspiration** | Improper positioning, high residuals, tube displacement | Elevate HOB, check placement, monitor residuals, suction if needed |
| **Diarrhea** | Formula too concentrated, too fast, lactose, contamination, medications | Slow rate, dilute formula, change formula, check expiration |
| **Constipation** | Inadequate fluid, lack of fiber, immobility | Increase free water, high-fiber formula, increase activity |
| **Nausea/Vomiting** | Too fast, high residuals, delayed gastric emptying | Slow rate, check residuals, consider promotility agent |
| **Tube clogging** | Inadequate flushing, thick medications | Flush regularly, use liquid meds when possible, warm water flush |
| **Infection (PEG site)** | Poor site care | Clean site daily, assess for redness/drainage |

**NEVER**:
- Use carbonated beverages to unclog (creates pressure)
- Mix medications with formula
- Add blue dye to formula (can cause complications)

## 💉 Parenteral Nutrition (PN)

### Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN)

**Definition**: IV nutrition providing all daily nutritional requirements

**Indications**:
- **Non-functioning GI tract**
- Severe malnutrition with GI dysfunction
- Bowel obstruction, fistulas
- Short bowel syndrome
- Severe pancreatitis
- Prolonged ileus
- **When enteral feeding fails or contraindicated**

**Components**:
- Amino acids (protein)
- Dextrose (carbohydrate) - HIGH concentration
- Lipids (fat emulsion)
- Electrolytes
- Vitamins and minerals
- Trace elements

### Administration

**Central line required** for TPN:
- High osmolality (>10% dextrose) damages peripheral veins
- Delivered via PICC, central venous catheter, or port
- Infused continuously via pump

**Peripheral Parenteral Nutrition (PPN)**:
- Lower concentration dextrose (<10%)
- Short-term use only (5-7 days)
- Peripheral IV adequate

### Nursing Management

#### Monitoring
**Vital signs**:
- Every 4-8 hours initially
- Temperature (infection risk)

**Blood glucose**:
- Every 4-6 hours initially
- High dextrose concentration → hyperglycemia
- May require insulin

**Daily weights**: Monitor for fluid retention/malnutrition

**Intake/output**: Strict monitoring

**Labs**:
- Glucose daily
- Electrolytes, BUN, creatinine
- Liver function tests
- Lipid panel
- Albumin, prealbumin

#### Administration Guidelines
```
TPN ADMINISTRATION RULES:
  ✓ Use dedicated lumen for TPN (no other meds/fluids)
  ✓ Use infusion pump (precise rate critical)
  ✓ Never abruptly stop TPN (risk hypoglycemia)
  ✓ If TPN interrupted, hang D10W at same rate
  ✓ Change tubing every 24 hours
  ✓ Refrigerate, warm to room temp 30 min before use
  ✓ Use inline filter (lipids need special filter)
  ✓ Do NOT speed up if behind (hyperglycemia risk)
```

### Complications

| Complication | Cause | Signs/Symptoms | Prevention/Treatment |
|--------------|-------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Hyperglycemia** | High dextrose concentration | Glucose >200, polyuria, thirst | Monitor glucose, insulin coverage, slow rate |
| **Hypoglycemia** | Sudden TPN discontinuation | Glucose <70, shakiness, sweating | NEVER stop abruptly; taper or give D10W |
| **Infection/Sepsis** | Central line contamination | Fever, chills, ↑ WBC | Strict aseptic technique, sterile dressing changes, dedicated lumen |
| **Fluid overload** | Excessive rate/volume | Edema, crackles, dyspnea, weight gain | Monitor I&O, daily weights, slow rate |
| **Electrolyte imbalances** | Refeeding syndrome, inadequate replacement | Variable | Monitor labs closely, replace as needed |
| **Air embolism** | Line disconnection, improper technique | Sudden dyspnea, chest pain, ↓ BP | Secure connections, place in Trendelenburg for line changes |

**Refeeding Syndrome**:
- Occurs when severely malnourished patient receives nutrition
- Rapid shift of electrolytes intracellularly
- **Watch for**: ↓ Phosphorus, ↓ Potassium, ↓ Magnesium
- **Prevention**: Start TPN slowly, monitor electrolytes closely, supplement PRN

## 🎯 NCLEX Tips

### High-Yield Points

1. **Enteral nutrition preferred** over parenteral (if GI tract works, use it!)
2. **Aspiration prevention**: HOB elevated 30-45° during and 30-60 min after feeding
3. **NEVER abruptly stop TPN** → hang D10W to prevent hypoglycemia
4. **Check NG tube placement** with pH (not whoosh test!)
5. **Hold enteral feeding** if residual >500 mL
6. **TPN requires central line** (except PPN)
7. **Potassium NEVER IV push** - causes cardiac arrest
8. **Low-sodium for heart failure/hypertension**, high-sodium contraindicated
9. **Diabetic diet**: carbohydrate counting, consistent intake
10. **Renal diet**: restrict protein (pre-dialysis), potassium, phosphorus, sodium

### Priority Concepts

**ABC Priority**:
- **Airway**: Aspiration risk with enteral feeding - always elevate HOB
- **Breathing**: Fluid overload from TPN can cause pulmonary edema
- **Circulation**: Electrolyte imbalances affect cardiac function

**Safety**:
- Verify tube placement before EVERY feeding
- Use pump for continuous feedings
- Monitor glucose with TPN

**Teaching**:
- Dietary restrictions and rationale
- How to read food labels
- Meal planning
- Home tube feeding management

## ✅ Practice Questions

<details>
<summary>1. Patient is receiving continuous tube feeding. What is the PRIORITY nursing action?</summary>

**Answer**: Keep the head of bed elevated at least 30 degrees

**Rationale**: Aspiration prevention is the priority concern with tube feedings. Keeping HOB elevated prevents formula from refluxing and being aspirated. This should be maintained during and for 30-60 minutes after feeding.
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Nurse checks gastric residual and obtains 550 mL. What action should the nurse take?</summary>

**Answer**: Hold the feeding and notify the healthcare provider

**Rationale**: Residual >500 mL indicates delayed gastric emptying and increases aspiration risk. Feeding should be held and provider notified. The residual should be returned to the stomach (contains electrolytes and digestive enzymes).
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Which food should be AVOIDED by a patient on a low-potassium diet?</summary>

**Answer**: Bananas

**Rationale**: Bananas are very high in potassium. Other high-potassium foods include oranges, potatoes, tomatoes, avocados, and spinach. Low-potassium diet is used for patients with chronic kidney disease or hyperkalemia.
</details>

<details>
<summary>4. Patient on TPN reports feeling shaky and dizzy after TPN was accidentally stopped for 2 hours. What should the nurse assess FIRST?</summary>

**Answer**: Blood glucose level

**Rationale**: Sudden discontinuation of TPN can cause hypoglycemia because the body has been producing insulin in response to high glucose concentrations. Patient is showing signs of hypoglycemia. Check glucose immediately and give D10W if TPN cannot be restarted.
</details>

<details>
<summary>5. Which finding indicates the patient understands teaching about a low-sodium diet?</summary>

**Answer**: "I will use lemon juice and herbs to season my food instead of salt."

**Rationale**: Using herbs, spices, and lemon juice instead of salt demonstrates understanding. Patients should avoid processed foods, canned soups, lunch meats, and adding salt to food. Fresh foods are better than processed.
</details>

<details>
<summary>6. Patient has a new PEG tube. Which action by the nurse is CORRECT?</summary>

**Answer**: Flush the tube with 30 mL of water before and after each feeding

**Rationale**: Flushing the tube with water before and after feedings and medications prevents clogging and maintains tube patency. This is essential tube feeding maintenance.
</details>

<details>
<summary>7. Patient with chronic kidney disease asks which food is safe to eat. What is the BEST response?</summary>

**Answer**: "You can have white rice and chicken."

**Rationale**: White rice (low potassium, low phosphorus) and chicken (moderate protein) are appropriate for renal diet. Should avoid bananas, oranges, tomatoes, chocolate, nuts (high potassium); dairy, cola, beans (high phosphorus).
</details>

<details>
<summary>8. What is the PRIORITY intervention for a patient with suspected tube feeding aspiration?</summary>

**Answer**: Stop the feeding and suction the airway

**Rationale**: If aspiration occurs, immediately stop feeding and suction to clear airway (ABCs - Airway first). Then assess respiratory status, notify provider, and obtain chest X-ray. Prevention includes HOB elevation and checking residuals.
</details>
