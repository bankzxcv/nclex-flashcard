### Urinary Problems

#### Urinary Retention

**Definition**: Inability to empty bladder completely

**Causes**:
- Obstruction (BPH, tumor, stricture)
- Neurological (spinal cord injury, stroke)
- Medications (anticholinergics, opioids, anesthesia)
- Post-operative (anesthesia, pain, positioning)
- Anxiety, lack of privacy

**Assessment**:
- Bladder distention (palpable above pubis)
- Discomfort, urgency
- Frequent small voids (<100 mL)
- Dull percussion over bladder
- Urinary frequency with small amounts

**Interventions**:
```
PROMOTING VOIDING:
  ✓ Privacy
  ✓ Normal position (upright for women, standing for men)
  ✓ Running water
  ✓ Warm water over perineum
  ✓ Relaxation
  ✓ Adequate time
  ✓ Pain management

If interventions fail:
  • Bladder scan to assess volume
  • Straight catheterization (if >400-500 mL)
  • Notify provider
```

#### Urinary Incontinence

**Types**:

| Type | Description | Causes | Interventions |
|------|-------------|--------|---------------|
| **Stress** | Leakage with increased abdominal pressure | Weak pelvic floor, childbirth, menopause | Kegel exercises, weight loss, surgery |
| **Urge** | Sudden strong urge, can't reach toilet | Overactive bladder, UTI, diabetes | Bladder training, anticholinergics, avoid bladder irritants |
| **Overflow** | Constant dribbling, bladder never empties | Obstruction, neurogenic bladder | Scheduled voiding, catheterization, treat obstruction |
| **Functional** | Physical/cognitive inability to reach toilet | Immobility, dementia, restraints | Scheduled toileting, accessibility, prompted voiding |
| **Mixed** | Combination of types | Various | Address each component |
| **Total** | Continuous unpredictable leakage | Fistula, neurological damage | Depends on cause; may need catheter |

**Kegel Exercises** (Pelvic Floor Strengthening):
- Tighten pelvic muscles (as if stopping urine flow)
- Hold 5-10 seconds
- Relax 5-10 seconds
- Repeat 10 times, 3-4 times/day
- **Do NOT do while urinating** (can cause retention/UTI)

**Bladder Training**:
1. Keep voiding diary
2. Establish schedule (every 2-3 hours)
3. Gradually increase intervals
4. Practice urge suppression techniques
5. Positive reinforcement

#### Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)

**Risk Factors**:
- **Female gender** (short urethra)
- **Catheterization**
- Sexual activity
- Pregnancy
- Diabetes
- Urinary stasis
- Poor hygiene

**Assessment**:
- **Lower UTI (Cystitis)**:
  - Dysuria (painful urination)
  - Frequency, urgency
  - Suprapubic pain
  - Cloudy, foul-smelling urine
  - Hematuria

- **Upper UTI (Pyelonephritis)**:
  - All cystitis symptoms PLUS
  - Fever, chills

  - Nausea, vomiting
  - Costovertebral angle (CVA) tenderness

**Prevention**:
```
UTI PREVENTION:
  ✓ Adequate fluid intake (2-3 L/day)
  ✓ Void every 2-4 hours
  ✓ Void after intercourse
  ✓ Wipe front to back (women)
  ✓ Avoid bladder irritants (caffeine, alcohol, spicy foods)
  ✓ Cranberry juice/supplements (acidifies urine)
  ✓ Avoid tight-fitting clothes
  ✓ Cotton underwear
  ✓ Shower instead of baths
  ✓ Avoid indwelling catheters when possible
```

### 🚰 Catheterization

#### Indications

**Appropriate Uses**:
- Urinary retention with bladder distention
- Accurate I&O measurement (critically ill)
- Surgery (prolonged, urological)
- Urinary obstruction
- Wounds contaminated by urine
- End-of-life comfort
- Prolonged immobilization (spinal injury)

**Inappropriate Uses** (AVOID):
- Convenience
- Incontinence management (use other methods first)
- Staff shortage

---

#### Types of Catheters

| Type | Description | Use |
|------|-------------|-----|
| **Straight (intermittent)** | Single use, remove after voiding | Residual check, temporary relief |
| **Indwelling (Foley)** | Inflated balloon holds in place | Continuous drainage, surgery |
| **Suprapubic** | Inserted through abdominal wall into bladder | Long-term, urethral damage, post-prostate surgery |
| **External (condom)** | Fits over penis, drains to bag | Male incontinence (non-invasive) |

---

#### Indwelling Catheter Insertion

**Supplies** (Sterile):
- Catheterization kit
- Appropriate catheter size (14-16 Fr adult)
- Sterile gloves
- Antiseptic solution
- Sterile water (for balloon)
- Drainage bag

**Procedure**:
```
FEMALE CATHETERIZATION:
  1. Position supine, knees flexed, feet apart
  2. Sterile technique throughout
  3. Clean with antiseptic (front to back)
     • Labia majora (both sides)
     • Labia minora (both sides)
     • Urethral meatus (center, last)
  4. Insert catheter 2-3 inches until urine flows
  5. Insert another 1-2 inches
  6. Inflate balloon (5-10 mL sterile water)
  7. Pull back gently until resistance felt
  8. Secure to inner thigh (prevents urethral trauma)

MALE CATHETERIZATION:
  1. Position supine
  2. Hold penis at 90° angle
  3. Retract foreskin (if uncircumcised)
  4. Clean meatus in circular motion (inside out)
  5. Insert catheter 7-9 inches until urine flows
  6. Lower penis to 45°, insert another inch
  7. Inflate balloon
  8. Replace foreskin (prevents paraphimosis)
  9. Secure to abdomen or thigh
```

**Never**:
- Force catheter (risk urethral trauma)
- Inflate balloon before urine return
- Forget to replace foreskin in uncircumcised males

---

#### Catheter Care & Maintenance

**Daily Care**:
```
CATHETER MAINTENANCE:
  ✓ Clean meatus with soap and water daily
  ✓ Clean catheter tubing 4 inches from meatus
  ✓ Keep drainage bag below bladder level (NEVER on floor)

- Wipe spout with alcohol after emptying
- Record output

**Urine Specimen Collection**:
- Use sterile specimen port (NOT from drainage bag)
- Clean port with alcohol
- Use sterile syringe/needle
- Aspirate 5-10 mL
- Transfer to sterile container

---

#### Catheter Complications

| Complication | Assessment | Intervention |
|--------------|------------|--------------|
| **CAUTI** (Catheter-Associated UTI) | Fever, cloudy/foul urine, dysuria | Aseptic technique, remove ASAP, antibiotics |
| **Obstruction** | No urine output, bladder distention | Check for kinks, irrigation if ordered |
| **Leakage** | Urine around catheter | Check for obstruction, balloon inflation; may need larger catheter |
| **Urethral trauma** | Bleeding, pain | Gentle insertion, adequate lubrication |
| **Bladder spasms** | Pain, cramping, leakage | Anticholinergics, ensure no obstruction |

**CAUTI Prevention - "CAUTI Bundle"**:
1. Insert only when necessary
2. Use aseptic technique
3. Maintain closed system
4. Keep bag below bladder
5. Daily assessment of need
6. Remove as soon as possible
7. Consider alternatives (external catheter, intermittent cath)

---

#### Catheter Removal

**Procedure**:
1. Explain procedure
2. Empty drainage bag, note amount
3. Clean gloves
4. Deflate balloon (aspirate all water)
5. Ask patient to take deep breath
6. Remove gently but smoothly
7. Clean perineum
8. Monitor first void (time, amount)

**Post-Removal Monitoring**:
- Should void within 6-8 hours
- Monitor for retention, dysuria
- Assess for UTI symptoms
- May have frequency, urgency initially (resolves)

---

### Urinary Diversion (Ostomy)

#### Ileal Conduit

**Description**: Ureters attached to segment of ileum, brought to abdominal surface as stoma

**Characteristics**:
- Most common urinary diversion
- Non-continent (continuous drainage)
- Requires external pouch
- Urine contains mucus (from intestinal segment - normal)

**Care**:
- Empty pouch when 1/3 to 1/2 full
- Change system every 3-7 days
- Stoma should be red/pink and moist
- Measure and fit properly (prevent leakage/skin damage)
- Use skin barrier

---

## 💩 Bowel Elimination

### Normal Bowel Function

**Characteristics of Normal Stool**:
- **Color**: Brown
- **Consistency**: Soft, formed
- **Frequency**: 3 times/day to 3 times/week (varies)
- **Amount**: 150 grams/day average
- **Odor**: Characteristic (not foul)
- **Shape**: Tubular

**Bristol Stool Chart**:
```
Type 1: Separate hard lumps (constipated)
Type 2: Lumpy, sausage-shaped (slightly constipated)
Type 3: Sausage with cracks (normal)
Type 4: Smooth, soft sausage (normal)
Type 5: Soft blobs (lacking fiber)
Type 6: Mushy, fluffy pieces (mild diarrhea)
Type 7: Watery, no solids (severe diarrhea)
```

---

### Bowel Problems

#### Constipation

**Definition**: Infrequent, difficult passage of hard, dry stool

**Causes**:
- Inadequate fiber/fluid
- Immobility
- Medications (opioids, iron, anticholinergics)
- Ignoring urge to defecate
- Aging (decreased peristalsis)
- Neurological conditions
- Obstruction

**Assessment**:
- <3 stools/week
- Straining
- Hard, pellet-like stools
- Feeling of incomplete evacuation
- Abdominal distention, discomfort
- Decreased bowel sounds

**Interventions**:
```
CONSTIPATION MANAGEMENT:
  ✓ Increase fiber (25-35 g/day)
  ✓ Increase fluids (2-3 L/day) - ESSENTIAL with fiber!
  ✓ Regular exercise
  ✓ Establish regular bowel routine
  ✓ Don't ignore urge
  ✓ Privacy, adequate time
  ✓ Warm liquids (stimulate peristalsis)
  ✓ Stool softeners (docusate)
  ✓ Laxatives (if non-pharm fails)
```

**Laxative Types**:

| Type | Example | Action | Onset |
|------|---------|--------|-------|
| **Bulk-forming** | Psyllium (Metamucil) | Absorb water, increase mass | 12-72 hr |
| **Stool softener** | Docusate (Colace) | Soften stool | 24-72 hr |
| **Osmotic** | Lactulose, MiraLAX | Draw water into colon | 6-48 hr |
| **Stimulant** | Bisacodyl (Dulcolax), Senna | Stimulate peristalsis | 6-12 hr |
| **Lubricant** | Mineral oil | Lubricate stool | 6-8 hr |
| **Saline** | Magnesium citrate | Draw water into bowel | 0.5-3 hr |

**Warnings**:
- Don't use stimulant laxatives long-term (dependence)
- Increase fiber GRADUALLY (prevent gas/bloating)
- MUST increase fluids with fiber (can worsen constipation)

---

#### Fecal Impaction

**Definition**: Hard, dry stool wedged in rectum, unable to pass

**Assessment**:
- No stool for several days
- Rectal fullness
- **Liquid stool seeping around impaction** (often mistaken for diarrhea!)
- Abdominal distention, pain
- Anorexia, nausea

**Intervention**:
- **Digital removal** (if ordered):
  - Lubricated gloved finger
  - Break up and remove fecal mass
  - **CAUTION**: Can stimulate vagal response → bradycardia
  - Monitor HR, stop if bradycardia
- Oil retention enema
- Prevention (fluids, fiber, mobility)

---

#### Diarrhea

**Definition**: Frequent passage of loose, watery stools

**Causes**:
- Infection (viral, bacterial, parasitic)
- Medications (antibiotics, laxatives)
- Food intolerance (lactose)
- Inflammatory bowel disease
- Tube feedings (too fast, concentrated)
- Anxiety/stress
- C. difficile (antibiotic-associated)

**Assessment**:
- Frequency, amount, consistency, color
- Associated symptoms (cramping, fever, blood, mucus)
- **Dehydration signs** (priority concern)
- Skin breakdown (perianal area)

**Interventions**:
```
DIARRHEA MANAGEMENT:
  ✓ Increase fluids (oral rehydration solution)
  ✓ Monitor I&O
  ✓ Electrolyte monitoring
  ✓ BRAT diet initially (Bananas, Rice, Applesauce, Toast)
  ✓ Avoid dairy, caffeine, fatty/spicy foods
  ✓ Antidiarrheals (if not infectious cause)
  ✓ Perianal skin care (barrier cream)
  ✓ Identify and treat cause
  ✓ Contact precautions if infectious
```

**C. difficile**:
- Antibiotic-associated diarrhea
- **Watery, foul-smelling** stool
- Fever, abdominal cramping
- **Contact precautions**
- **Soap and water hand hygiene** (alcohol doesn't kill spores!)
- Treatment: Stop offending antibiotic, metronidazole or vancomycin

---

#### Flatulence

**Causes**: Swallowed air, gas-producing foods, immobility, surgery

**Interventions**:
- Ambulation (promotes peristalsis)
- Avoid gas-producing foods (beans, cabbage, onions, carbonated drinks)
- Avoid straws, gum (decrease swallowed air)
- Simethicone
- Rectal tube (if severe and other methods fail)

---

### 🧴 Enemas

**Purpose**: Stimulate peristalsis, soften stool, evacuate bowel

**Types**:

| Type | Volume | Use |
|------|--------|-----|
| **Cleansing (tap water, saline)** | 500-1000 mL adult | Bowel prep, constipation |
| **Hypertonic (Fleet)** | 120-150 mL | Quick evacuation |
| **Oil retention** | 150-200 mL | Soften impaction (retain 1-3 hours) |
| **Carminative** | Variable | Expel flatus |
| **Medicated** | Variable | Deliver medication |

**Administration**:
```
ENEMA PROCEDURE:
  1. Warm solution to room temp (105-110°F)
     • Too cold: cramping
     • Too hot: tissue damage
  2. Position left side-lying (Sims)
  3. Lubricate tip
  4. Insert 3-4 inches (adult), angled toward umbilicus
  5. Hold bag 12-18 inches above rectum
  6. Instill slowly (rapid = cramping)
  7. Retain 5-15 minutes (or as directed)
  8. Assist to toilet/bedpan
```

**Contraindications**:
- Bowel obstruction
- Recent bowel/rectal surgery
- Severe abdominal pain (unknown cause)
- Rectal bleeding
- Inflammatory bowel disease (acute phase)

### 🎒 Ostomies

**Types by Location**:

| Type | Location | Stool Consistency | Management |
|------|----------|-------------------|------------|
| **Ileostomy** | Ileum (small intestine) | Liquid to semi-liquid, continuous | Pouch always; high fluid/electrolyte loss |
| **Ascending colostomy** | Right colon | Semi-liquid | Pouch always |
| **Transverse colostomy** | Across upper abdomen | Semi-formed to pasty | Pouch always |
| **Descending/Sigmoid colostomy** | Left colon | Formed (near-normal) | Pouch or irrigation |

**Continent vs. Incontinent**:
- **Incontinent**: No control, continuous drainage (most common) - requires pouch
- **Continent**: Internal pouch, drain with catheter (Kock pouch)

---

#### Ostomy Care

**Assessment**:
```
STOMA ASSESSMENT:
  Normal:
    • Red/pink, moist (like oral mucosa)
    • Slight bleeding when cleaned (highly vascular)
    • Protruding or flush with skin
    • No odor (well-maintained)

  Abnormal:
    • Dark, dusky, black (ischemia/necrosis - EMERGENCY)
    • Pale (decreased perfusion)
    • Severe bleeding
    • Stenosis (narrowing)
    • Prolapse (protruding into pouch)
    • Retraction (pulls below skin)
```

**Pouch Change**:
1. Empty pouch first
2. Gently remove old wafer
3. Clean skin with warm water (pat dry)
4. Assess stoma and peristomal skin
5. Measure stoma (can shrink over time)
6. Cut wafer opening 1/8 inch larger than stoma
7. Apply skin barrier
8. Apply wafer and pouch
9. Check seal

**Pouching Tips**:
- Empty when 1/3 to 1/2 full (prevents leakage)
- Change wafer every 3-7 days (or if leaking)
- Good seal essential (prevents skin breakdown)
- No opening in wafer (skin contact with output = breakdown)

---

#### Colostomy Irrigation

**Purpose**: Regulate bowel movements (descending/sigmoid colostomy)

**Procedure**:
1. Similar to enema
2. 500-1000 mL warm water
3. Allow return (30-45 minutes)
4. Can achieve regularity, pouch-free intervals

**Not for**:
- Ileostomy (liquid stool, electrolyte loss)
- Ascending/transverse colostomy

---

#### Complications

| Complication | Description | Intervention |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Skin breakdown** | Peristomal irritation/excoriation | Proper fit, skin barrier, treat Candida if present |
| **Odor** | Abnormal smell | Check pouch seal, dietary modification, deodorant drops |
| **Blockage** | No output, cramping, distention | Massage, warm fluids, knee-chest position; notify provider if no relief |
| **Prolapse** | Stoma protrudes further | Apply ice, gentle pressure; may need surgery |
| **Retraction** | Stoma below skin level | Convex wafer; may need surgical revision |
| **Necrosis** | Dark/black stoma | EMERGENCY - notify surgeon immediately |
| **Hernia** | Bulge around stoma | Support, may need surgical repair |

---

#### Dietary Considerations

**Ileostomy**:
- High fluid intake (output is liquid)
- Salt replacement
- Avoid high-fiber foods initially (can cause blockage)
- Chew food well

**Colostomy**:
- Resume normal diet gradually
- **Gas-producing**: Beans, cabbage, onions, carbonated drinks
- **Odor-producing**: Eggs, fish, onions, garlic
- **Odor-reducing**: Yogurt, buttermilk, parsley, cranberry juice

**Foods that can cause blockage** (ileostomy):
- Popcorn, nuts, seeds
- Raw vegetables (corn, celery, coleslaw)
- Skins, membranes
- Coconut

## 🎯 NCLEX Tips

### High-Yield Points

1. **Catheter bag always below bladder** level (prevents backflow/infection)
2. **Straight cath** for residual, **indwelling** for continuous drainage
3. **CAUTI prevention**: Remove catheter ASAP, maintain closed system
4. **Soap and water** for C. diff (alcohol doesn't kill spores)
5. **Dark/black stoma = emergency** (necrosis - notify surgeon)
6. **Ileostomy output is liquid** (high fluid/electrolyte loss)
7. **Digital removal of impaction** can cause vagal response (bradycardia)
8. **Liquid stool around hard stool** = impaction (not diarrhea!)
9. **Increase fluids WITH fiber** (fiber without fluid worsens constipation)
10. **First void after catheter removal**: within 6-8 hours

### Priority Concepts

**Safety**:
- Aseptic technique for catheterization
- Monitor for complications (CAUTI, retention)
- Prevent skin breakdown (incontinence, ostomy)

**Teaching**:
- Ostomy self-care
- Catheter care (if home)
- Dietary modifications
- When to report problems

**Delegation**:
- **CAN delegate to UAP**: Routine catheter care, I&O, ostomy pouch emptying (stable patient)
- **CANNOT delegate**: Catheter insertion, assessment, ostomy pouch change, teaching

## ✅ Practice Questions

<details>
<summary>1. What is the PRIORITY action before inserting an indwelling urinary catheter?</summary>

**Answer**: Perform hand hygiene and set up sterile field

**Rationale**: Strict aseptic technique is essential to prevent CAUTI. Hand hygiene and sterile technique throughout the procedure are the most important interventions to prevent infection.
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Patient has an indwelling catheter. Nurse notes the drainage bag is hanging on the bed rail above the level of the bladder. What action should the nurse take?</summary>

**Answer**: Lower the drainage bag below the level of the bladder immediately

**Rationale**: Drainage bag must always be below bladder level to prevent backflow of urine into bladder (increases infection risk). Never place on floor (contamination) but must be below bladder.
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Which patient statement indicates understanding of ileostomy care?</summary>

**Answer**: "I'll need to drink extra fluids because I lose a lot through my stoma."

**Rationale**: Ileostomy output is liquid and continuous, causing high fluid and electrolyte losses. Patient must increase fluid intake to prevent dehydration. This demonstrates understanding.
</details>

<details>
<summary>4. Nurse is assessing a patient's colostomy stoma. Which finding requires IMMEDIATE intervention?</summary>

**Answer**: The stoma is dark purple and dusky

**Rationale**: Dark, dusky, purple, or black stoma indicates ischemia/necrosis and is a surgical emergency. Stoma should be red/pink and moist. Notify surgeon immediately.
</details>

<details>
<summary>5. Patient reports no bowel movement for 4 days and now has liquid stool leaking. What should the nurse suspect?</summary>

**Answer**: Fecal impaction

**Rationale**: Liquid stool seeping around hard impacted stool is a classic sign of fecal impaction. This is often mistaken for diarrhea. Nurse should assess for impaction and report to provider for possible digital removal order.
</details>

<details>
<summary>6. Which action prevents CAUTI in a patient with an indwelling catheter?</summary>

**Answer**: Maintain a closed urinary drainage system

**Rationale**: Keeping the drainage system closed prevents introduction of bacteria and is a key CAUTI prevention measure. Opening the system breaks the sterile environment and increases infection risk.
</details>

<details>
<summary>7. Patient is receiving instruction on performing Kegel exercises for stress incontinence. Which statement requires correction?</summary>

**Answer**: "I should practice these exercises while I'm urinating."

**Rationale**: This is INCORRECT. Kegel exercises should NOT be performed while urinating as this can cause incomplete bladder emptying and increase UTI risk. Patient should tighten pelvic floor muscles at other times.
</details>

<details>
<summary>8. When administering an enema, the nurse should position the patient in which position?</summary>

**Answer**: Left side-lying (Sims' position)

**Rationale**: Left side-lying (Sims') position is best for enema administration. This position follows the natural curve of the colon and uses gravity to help solution flow into the bowel.
</details>
