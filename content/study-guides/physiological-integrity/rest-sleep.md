## 😴 Sleep Physiology

### Sleep Stages

**NREM (Non-Rapid Eye Movement) Sleep**:

| Stage | Characteristics | % of Sleep | EEG Waves |
|-------|----------------|------------|-----------|
| **NREM 1** | Light sleep, easily awakened, transition | 5% | Theta waves |
| **NREM 2** | Deeper sleep, body temp drops, HR slows | 45-55% | Sleep spindles, K-complexes |
| **NREM 3** | Deep sleep (slow-wave sleep), restorative, hard to wake | 15-25% | Delta waves |

**REM (Rapid Eye Movement) Sleep**:
- **Characteristics**: Vivid dreams, rapid eye movements, muscle paralysis (except diaphragm, eyes), brain activity similar to waking
- **Percentage**: 20-25% of sleep
- **Function**: Memory consolidation, learning, emotional processing
- **EEG**: Beta waves (similar to awake)

### Sleep Cycle

## 💊 Sleep Medications

### Medication Classes

| Class | Examples | Mechanism | Considerations |
|-------|----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Benzodiazepines** | Temazepam, Triazolam | GABA agonist | Dependence risk, tolerance, withdrawal; avoid long-term |
| **Non-benzodiazepine hypnotics** | Zolpidem (Ambien), Eszopiclone (Lunesta) | GABA agonist (selective) | Less dependence than benzos; complex sleep behaviors possible |
| **Melatonin receptor agonists** | Ramelteon (Rozerem) | Melatonin receptor | No dependence, good for circadian issues |
| **Orexin receptor antagonists** | Suvorexant (Belsomra) | Block wakefulness system | Newer class, well-tolerated |
| **Sedating antidepressants** | Trazodone, Mirtazapine | Various | Off-label for sleep, less dependence |
| **Antihistamines** | Diphenhydramine (Benadryl), Doxylamine | Histamine antagonist | OTC, tolerance develops, anticholinergic effects |

**Nursing Considerations**:
- Use lowest effective dose, shortest duration
- Non-pharmacological interventions first
- Avoid in older adults when possible (falls risk, confusion)
- Take 30 minutes before bed
- Avoid alcohol
- Don't drive or operate machinery
- May cause morning drowsiness

---

## 👴 Sleep in Older Adults

### Age-Related Changes

```
OLDER ADULT SLEEP CHANGES:
  • Takes longer to fall asleep
  • More awakenings during night
  • Less deep sleep (NREM 3)
  • Less REM sleep
  • Earlier bedtime, earlier waking
  • More daytime napping
  • Lighter sleep (easily awakened)
  • Overall sleep efficiency decreases
```

**NOT normal**: Excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep apnea

### Contributing Factors
- Medical conditions (arthritis pain, nocturia, GERD, heart/lung disease)
- Medications (diuretics, steroids, some antidepressants)
- Depression, anxiety, grief
- Inactivity
- Environmental changes

### Interventions
- Evaluate and treat medical conditions
- Medication review (adjust timing, consider alternatives)
- Encourage daytime activity, limit naps
- Pain management
- Sleep hygiene education
- Cognitive behavioral therapy
- **Avoid sedatives** when possible (falls, confusion, dependence)

## 🎯 NCLEX Tips

### High-Yield Points

1. **REM sleep**: Vivid dreams, memory consolidation, muscle paralysis (except eyes/diaphragm)
2. **NREM 3 (deep sleep)**: Physical restoration, tissue repair, hard to wake
3. **Sleep deprivation effects**: Decreased concentration, impaired judgment, irritability
4. **Insomnia**: Non-pharmacological interventions FIRST (sleep hygiene, CBT-I)
5. **Sleep apnea**: CPAP is gold standard treatment
6. **Hospital sleep**: Average 4-5 hours (inadequate), cluster care to minimize interruptions
7. **Older adults**: Sleep architecture changes normal, but excessive daytime sleepiness is NOT
8. **Sleep hygiene**: Consistent schedule, dark/cool/quiet room, avoid screens/caffeine before bed
9. **If can't sleep after 20 min**: Get out of bed, do quiet activity
10. **Benzodiazepines**: Short-term only (dependence risk), avoid in elderly

### Priority Nursing Diagnoses
- Disturbed Sleep Pattern
- Insomnia
- Sleep Deprivation
- Fatigue
- Risk for Injury (related to sleepiness)

### Teaching Priorities
- Sleep hygiene education
- Medication compliance (CPAP for sleep apnea)
- Safety (no driving if excessively sleepy)
- When to seek help (persistent insomnia, loud snoring with pauses)

## ✅ Practice Questions

<details>
<summary>1. Which nursing intervention is MOST important for promoting sleep in a hospitalized patient?</summary>

**Answer**: Cluster nursing care activities to minimize interruptions during the night

**Rationale**: Frequent interruptions are a major cause of sleep disruption in hospitals. Clustering care activities (vital signs, medications, turning) reduces awakenings and allows for longer periods of uninterrupted sleep. This is more effective than individual comfort measures.
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Patient reports difficulty falling asleep despite feeling tired. What should the nurse teach FIRST?</summary>

**Answer**: "Establish a consistent sleep and wake schedule, even on weekends."

**Rationale**: Consistent sleep-wake times regulate circadian rhythm and are foundational to sleep hygiene. This is a first-line, non-pharmacological intervention for insomnia. Other sleep hygiene measures are also important, but schedule consistency is fundamental.
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Patient with sleep apnea is prescribed CPAP. Which statement indicates understanding?</summary>

**Answer**: "I need to use the CPAP every night for it to be effective."

**Rationale**: CPAP must be used consistently (nightly) to be effective. Compliance is essential. Skipping nights allows apnea to continue and negates the benefits.
</details>

<details>
<summary>4. Which patient is at HIGHEST risk for sleep apnea?</summary>

**Answer**: 55-year-old obese male who snores loudly

**Rationale**: Obesity is the largest risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea. Male gender, age >40, and loud snoring are also risk factors. This patient has multiple risk factors.
</details>

<details>
<summary>5. Older adult patient complains of waking frequently during the night. What is the nurse's BEST response?</summary>

**Answer**: "Some changes in sleep patterns are normal with aging. Let's discuss strategies to improve your sleep quality."

**Rationale**: Age-related sleep changes (lighter sleep, more awakenings) are normal. The nurse should acknowledge this while offering interventions to improve sleep quality. Excessive daytime sleepiness is NOT normal and should be evaluated.
</details>

<details>
<summary>6. Patient taking a benzodiazepine for sleep asks about stopping the medication. What should the nurse teach?</summary>

**Answer**: "Don't stop suddenly. Work with your doctor to gradually reduce the dose to prevent withdrawal."

**Rationale**: Benzodiazepines can cause physical dependence. Abrupt discontinuation can cause withdrawal symptoms (anxiety, tremors, seizures). Must taper gradually under medical supervision.
</details>

<details>
<summary>7. During which sleep stage does most physical restoration occur?</summary>

**Answer**: NREM Stage 3 (deep sleep)

**Rationale**: NREM Stage 3 (slow-wave sleep) is when physical restoration occurs: tissue repair, growth, immune function, energy restoration. This is the deepest stage of sleep.
</details>

<details>
<summary>8. Patient reports inability to sleep unless lying on back. Nurse notes loud snoring and gasping. What should the nurse suspect?</summary>

**Answer**: Sleep apnea

**Rationale**: Loud snoring with gasping sounds strongly suggests sleep apnea. Supine position often worsens obstructive sleep apnea. Patient should be evaluated with sleep study.
</details>
