## 🔍 Medication Safety

### Before Administration - The 3 Checks

1. **Check #1**: When removing medication from storage
2. **Check #2**: When preparing medication
3. **Check #3**: Before returning medication to storage OR at bedside before administration

### Patient Identification
**Verify using 2 identifiers**:
- Full name
- Date of birth
- Medical record number
- **NEVER** use room number

**Best Practice**: Scan patient armband barcode + ask patient to state name and DOB

### High-Alert Medications (Require Extra Caution)
- **Insulin**
- **Heparin** and anticoagulants
- **Opioids**
- **Chemotherapy**
- **Sedatives**
- **Potassium** (IV)
- **Neuromuscular blockers**

**Safety measures**: Double-check calculations, independent verification by second nurse

## 💉 Routes of Administration

### Oral (PO)

**Advantages**: Convenient, safe, economical
**Disadvantages**: Slower onset, cannot use if NPO/vomiting/unconscious

**Administration Tips**:
- Give with water unless contraindicated
- Stay and watch patient swallow (don't leave at bedside)
- Crush tablets only if not enteric-coated or extended-release
- Empty capsules only if appropriate
- Never crush: ER, SR, XL, CR, EC (extended/sustained release, enteric-coated)

**Special Considerations**:
- **Sublingual** (SL): Under tongue, do not swallow (e.g., nitroglycerin)
- **Buccal**: Between cheek and gum

### Intramuscular (IM)

**Common sites**:
- **Ventrogluteal** (preferred for adults - safer, less nerves/vessels)
- **Deltoid** (vaccines, small volumes <1 mL)
- **Vastus lateralis** (infants, children)
- **Dorsogluteal** (avoid due to sciatic nerve risk)

**Technique**:
- **Needle size**: 1-1.5 inch, 21-25 gauge
- **Angle**: 90 degrees
- **Volume**: Up to 3 mL adults, 1 mL deltoid
- **Z-track method**: For irritating medications (pull skin laterally before insertion)
- **Aspirate?**: Generally NO (current evidence), except if giving in dorsogluteal

**Site Selection**:
```
Ventrogluteal Landmark:
- Place heel of hand on greater trochanter
- Point fingers toward patient's head
- Index finger on anterior superior iliac spine
- Middle finger toward iliac crest
- Inject in center of triangle
```

### Subcutaneous (SubQ/SC)

**Common sites**: Abdomen (fastest absorption), outer arm, thigh, back

**Technique**:
- **Needle size**: 5/8 inch, 25-27 gauge
- **Angle**: 45-90 degrees (depending on needle length and adipose tissue)
- **Volume**: 0.5-1 mL maximum
- **Rotate sites**: Especially for insulin (prevents lipodystrophy)
- **Do NOT aspirate** (can cause tissue damage)
- **Do NOT massage** after injection (alters absorption)

**Common SubQ medications**:
- Insulin
- Heparin
- Lovenox (enoxaparin)
- Epinephrine

**Insulin Administration**:
- Rotate sites within same anatomical area
- Abdomen absorbs fastest, then arms, then thighs
- Give 30 minutes before meals (regular insulin)
- Give 15 minutes before meals (rapid-acting)

### Intravenous (IV)

**Advantages**: Immediate onset, 100% bioavailability, precise control
**Disadvantages**: Risk of infection, phlebitis, infiltration, extravasation

**IV Push (Bolus)**:
- Administer slowly over specified time
- Check compatibility with existing IV fluids
- Flush before and after with saline

**IV Piggyback (IVPB)**:
- Hang secondary bag higher than primary
- Back-prime to prevent air
- Common for antibiotics

**Continuous Infusion**:
- Use infusion pump for accuracy
- Monitor site frequently
- Label tubing with date/time

**Complications**:

| Complication | Signs | Intervention |
|--------------|-------|--------------|
| **Infiltration** | Swelling, coolness, pallor, pain | Stop IV, elevate extremity, warm compress |
| **Phlebitis** | Warmth, redness, pain along vein | Stop IV, apply warm compress |
| **Extravasation** | Severe tissue damage from vesicant | STOP immediately, don't flush, notify provider, antidote if available |
| **Air embolism** | Sudden dyspnea, chest pain, hypotension | Place on LEFT side in Trendelenburg |
| **Infection** | Redness, warmth, drainage at site | Remove IV, culture site if ordered |

## 🧮 Dosage Calculations

### Basic Formula Method
```
Desired Dose / Have on Hand × Vehicle (tablet, mL) = Amount to Give
```

**Example**: Order: Amoxicillin 500 mg PO. Have: 250 mg/tablet
```
500 mg / 250 mg × 1 tablet = 2 tablets
```

### Ratio-Proportion Method
```
Have : Vehicle :: Desired : X
```

**Example**: Order: Morphine 8 mg IV. Have: 10 mg/mL
```
10 mg : 1 mL :: 8 mg : X mL
10X = 8
X = 0.8 mL
```

### IV Flow Rate Calculations

**Formula**:
```
Flow Rate (mL/hr) = Total Volume (mL) / Total Time (hours)
```

**Example**: Infuse 1000 mL over 8 hours
```
1000 mL / 8 hr = 125 mL/hr
```

**Drops per minute (gtt/min)**:
```
(Volume × Drop Factor) / Time in minutes = gtt/min
```

**Example**: Infuse 100 mL over 1 hour. Drop factor = 15 gtt/mL
```
(100 × 15) / 60 = 25 gtt/min
```

### Pediatric Dosage (Weight-Based)

**Formula**:
```
Ordered dose (mg/kg/day) × Child's weight (kg) = Total daily dose
```

**Example**: Order: 10 mg/kg/day. Child weighs 20 kg
```
10 mg/kg × 20 kg = 200 mg/day
```

**Always verify**: Is calculated dose within safe range?

### BSA (Body Surface Area) Calculations
Used for chemotherapy, burn patients
```
BSA (m²) = √[(Height (cm) × Weight (kg)) / 3600]
```

## 🎯 NCLEX Tips

### High-Yield Points

1. **Always check HR before** beta blockers, digoxin
2. **Always check BP before** antihypertensives
3. **Always check respiratory rate before** opioids
4. **Two patient identifiers** - NEVER room number
5. **Never leave medication** at bedside (stay and watch patient take)
6. **Insulin** - most NCLEX questions about timing and site rotation
7. **Warfarin** - know INR therapeutic range (2.0-3.0)
8. **Heparin** - know aPTT therapeutic range (1.5-2× control)

### Question Strategies

**Priority questions**: What to do FIRST?
- Usually: **Assess** before intervening
- Exception: Life-threatening situations (stop medication in anaphylaxis)

**Delegation**: Can UAP give medications?
- **NO** - only licensed nurses can administer medications
- **Exception**: Stable patient, oral route, UAP has special training (some states)

**Teaching questions**:
- Focus on safety, adherence, side effects to report

## ✅ Common NCLEX Scenarios

<details>
<summary>1. Nurse is preparing to give digoxin. HR = 58 bpm. What action?</summary>

**Answer**: Hold medication and notify provider

**Rationale**: Hold digoxin if HR <60 bpm. Digoxin decreases heart rate, giving it could cause severe bradycardia.
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Patient refuses medication. What should nurse do?</summary>

**Answer**: Document refusal and notify provider

**Rationale**: Patient has right to refuse. Do not force or coerce. Document and inform provider.
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Which site is best for IM injection in adult?</summary>

**Answer**: Ventrogluteal

**Rationale**: Preferred site - large muscle, away from major nerves/vessels, less pain.
</details>

<details>
<summary>4. When teaching about warfarin, what should patient avoid?</summary>

**Answer**: Aspirin, NSAIDs, and activities with high fall/injury risk

**Rationale**: Avoid medications that increase bleeding risk. Maintain consistent Vitamin K intake (don't avoid, just be consistent).
</details>

<details>
<summary>5. Patient on IV has swelling, coolness at site. What is this?</summary>

**Answer**: Infiltration

**Rationale**: IV fluid leaking into surrounding tissue. STOP IV, elevate extremity, apply warm compress, restart IV elsewhere.
</details>
