## 🧬 Blood Typing & Compatibility

### ABO Blood Groups

**Antigens on RBCs, Antibodies in plasma**:

| Blood Type | RBC Antigens | Plasma Antibodies | Can Receive From | Can Donate To |
|------------|--------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------|
| **A** | A | Anti-B | A, O | A, AB |
| **B** | B | Anti-A | B, O | B, AB |
| **AB** | A and B | None | A, B, AB, O (Universal Recipient) | AB only |
| **O** | None | Anti-A and Anti-B | O only | A, B, AB, O (Universal Donor) |

**Remember**:
- **Type O = Universal DONOR** (RBCs have no antigens)
- **Type AB = Universal RECIPIENT** (plasma has no antibodies)

---

### Rh Factor

**Rh positive (+)**: Has Rh antigen (D antigen) on RBCs
**Rh negative (-)**: No Rh antigen

**Compatibility**:
- Rh+ can receive Rh+ or Rh-
- Rh- should receive Rh- only (can develop antibodies if given Rh+)

**Special Consideration**: Rh- women of childbearing age
- Must receive Rh- blood
- If exposed to Rh+ blood → RhoGAM to prevent sensitization

---

### Type and Crossmatch

**Type and Screen**:
- Determines ABO and Rh type
- Screens for unexpected antibodies
- Takes ~45 minutes

**Type and Crossmatch**:
- Type and screen PLUS
- Mixes patient serum with donor RBCs (crossmatch)
- Ensures compatibility
- Takes ~1 hour

**Emergency (life-threatening hemorrhage)**:
- **Type O negative** (universal donor) given without crossmatch
- Switch to type-specific when available

---

## 🩺 Transfusion Procedure

### Pre-Transfusion

**Consent**: Written informed consent required

**Physician order** must include:
- Type of product
- Number of units
- Rate of infusion
- Any special requirements (irradiated, CMV-negative, etc.)

**Patient assessment**:
```
BASELINE ASSESSMENT:
  ✓ Vital signs (T, P, R, BP)

- Duration
- Signs/symptoms to report (fever, chills, itching, SOB, back pain)
- Will be monitored frequently

---

### Verification (Critical Step!)

**Two licensed nurses** must verify at bedside:

```
DOUBLE-CHECK (Two RNs):
  ✓ Patient identity (2 identifiers: name, DOB)
  ✓ Blood unit number on bag matches paperwork
  ✓ Blood type on bag matches paperwork
  ✓ Expiration date (not expired)
  ✓ Inspect blood product:
     • No clots, discoloration, bubbles
     • Bag intact, no leaks
  ✓ Consent signed

IF ANY DISCREPANCY → DO NOT TRANSFUSE
Return blood to blood bank
```

**Documentation**: Both nurses sign verification

---

### Administration

**IV Access**:
- **18-20 gauge catheter** (18G preferred for rapid transfusion)
- Dedicated line or Y-type blood administration set
- **0.9% Normal Saline ONLY**
  - LR contains calcium (causes clotting)
  - Dextrose solutions (lyse RBCs)

**Filter**: Blood administration set has 170-260 micron filter (removes clots, debris)

**Priming**:
1. Prime tubing with 0.9% NS
2. Obtain blood from blood bank (must begin within 30 minutes)
3. Gently invert bag (mix RBCs)
4. Connect to patient

**Infusion Rate**:
```
TRANSFUSION RATE:
  First 15 minutes:
    • SLOW rate (2 mL/min or per policy)
    • STAY with patient
    • Monitor closely (most reactions occur early)

  After 15 min (if no reaction):
    • Increase to ordered rate
    • PRBCs: Usually over 2-4 hours (max 4 hours)
    • Platelets, FFP: Faster (30-60 min)

  NEVER exceed 4 hours per unit!
  (Bacterial growth, hemolysis)
```

**Monitoring**:
```
VITAL SIGNS:
  • Baseline (before starting)
  • 15 minutes after start
  • Hourly during transfusion
  • At completion
  • PRN if symptoms

ASSESSMENT:
  • Patient tolerance
  • Transfusion reaction signs
  • IV site patency
  • Infusion rate
```

---

### Post-Transfusion

**Final vital signs**: After completion

**Flush line**: With NS after blood product

**Dispose**: Blood bag and tubing per policy (usually return to blood bank or biohazard)

**Monitor**:
- For delayed reactions (hours to days)
- Labs if ordered (CBC, usually 4-6 hours post)

**Document**:
- Product type, unit number
- Start and end times
- Vital signs
- Patient tolerance
- Any reactions

**Signs/Symptoms**:
```
ACUTE HEMOLYTIC REACTION:
  • Fever, chills (often first sign)
  • Flank/back pain (kidney pain)
  • Chest pain, dyspnea
  • Hypotension, tachycardia
  • Red/brown urine (hemoglobinuria)
  • Bleeding (DIC)
  • Anxiety, sense of doom

Unconscious patient:
  • Hypotension
  • Bleeding from surgical sites
  • Hemoglobinuria
```

**Interventions**:
```
PRIORITY ACTIONS:
  1. STOP transfusion IMMEDIATELY
  2. Maintain IV access (new NS line, disconnect blood)
  3. Notify provider STAT
  4. Monitor vital signs continuously
  5. Send:
     • Blood bag and tubing to blood bank
     • Blood samples (recheck type, direct Coombs)
     • Urine sample (hemoglobin)
  6. Insert Foley catheter (monitor UOP)
  7. Administer:
     • IV fluids (prevent renal failure)
     • Oxygen
     • Medications as ordered (diuretics, vasopressors)
  8. Document everything
```

**Prevention**: Proper verification by TWO nurses

---

### Febrile Non-Hemolytic Reaction (Most Common)

2. Maintain IV access
3. Notify provider
4. Antipyretics (acetaminophen)
5. Obtain cultures if ordered (rule out sepsis)
6. May resume transfusion if fever resolves and other causes ruled out (per provider)

**Prevention**:
- Leukocyte-reduced blood products
- Premedicate with antipyretics (for patients with history)

---

### Allergic Reaction

**Cause**: Sensitivity to donor plasma proteins

**Onset**: During or shortly after

**Signs/Symptoms**:

---

### Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI)

**Cause**: Donor antibodies react with recipient WBCs → lung injury

**Onset**: Within 6 hours (usually 1-2 hours)

**Signs/Symptoms**:
```
TRALI PRESENTATION:
  • Acute respiratory distress
  • Severe dyspnea, hypoxia
  • Hypotension
  • Fever

  • Frothy pink sputum
  • NO fluid overload (normal CVP/PCWP)
```

**Interventions**:
1. STOP transfusion
2. Notify provider STAT
3. Oxygen (high-flow, may need mechanical ventilation)
4. Position upright
5. Monitor vital signs, oxygen saturation
6. Diuretics NOT helpful (not fluid overload)

**Key Difference from TACO**: TRALI has normal CVP (not fluid overload)

---

### Transfusion-Associated Circulatory Overload (TACO)

**Cause**: Too much volume too fast → fluid overload

**Onset**: During or within 6 hours

**Risk factors**: Heart failure, renal failure, elderly, infants

**Signs/Symptoms**:
```
TACO (FLUID OVERLOAD):
  • Dyspnea, tachypnea
  • Crackles in lungs
  • Hypertension
  • Bounding pulse
  • Jugular venous distention (JVD)
  • Headache
  • Peripheral edema
```

**Interventions**:
1. STOP or SLOW transfusion
2. Elevate head of bed
3. Oxygen
4. Notify provider
5. Diuretics (furosemide)
6. Monitor vital signs, I&O
7. May resume at slower rate (per provider)

**Prevention**:
- Slower infusion rate (especially for at-risk patients)
- Administer diuretic between units (if ordered)
- Monitor closely

---

### Septic Reaction (Bacterial Contamination)

## 🎯 NCLEX Tips

### High-Yield Points

1. **Two nurses verify** blood product at bedside (critical safety check)
2. **0.9% NS ONLY** with blood (never LR or dextrose)
3. **18-20G catheter** for blood transfusion
4. **Stay with patient first 15 minutes** (most reactions occur early)
5. **STOP transfusion immediately** if reaction suspected
6. **Max 4 hours** per unit (bacterial growth risk)
7. **Type O negative = universal donor**, **Type AB = universal recipient**
8. **Acute hemolytic reaction**: Flank/back pain, red urine, hypotension
9. **TRALI vs TACO**: TRALI has normal CVP (not fluid overload)
10. **Febrile reaction = most common**, **Hemolytic = most serious**

### Priority Actions for Transfusion Reaction

```
SUSPECTED REACTION:
  1. STOP transfusion immediately
  2. Maintain IV access (new NS line)
  3. Notify provider
  4. Stay with patient
  5. Assess airway, breathing, circulation
  6. Vital signs
  7. Save blood bag and tubing
  8. Follow protocol (cultures, labs, urine sample)
  9. Document
```

### Special Populations

**Jehovah's Witnesses**: Refuse blood transfusions (religious belief)
- Alternatives: Erythropoietin, iron, volume expanders, autologous blood (varies)
- Respect patient autonomy

**Immunocompromised**: Irradiated blood products (prevent GVHD)

**CMV-negative**: Immunocompromised, pregnant women, neonates

## ✅ Practice Questions

<details>
<summary>1. What is the FIRST action if a transfusion reaction is suspected?</summary>

**Answer**: Stop the transfusion immediately

**Rationale**: If any transfusion reaction is suspected, the FIRST action is to stop the transfusion to prevent further complications. Then maintain IV access with new NS line (disconnect blood), stay with patient, notify provider, and assess. Never continue the transfusion if reaction suspected.
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Which IV solution is compatible with blood products?</summary>

**Answer**: 0.9% Normal Saline

**Rationale**: ONLY 0.9% Normal Saline is compatible with blood products. Lactated Ringer's contains calcium (causes clotting). Dextrose solutions cause hemolysis (destroy RBCs). This is critical for patient safety.
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Patient receiving blood transfusion reports lower back pain and chills. Vital signs: T 101.2°F, BP 88/52, HR 118. What type of reaction is this?</summary>

**Answer**: Acute hemolytic reaction

**Rationale**: Acute hemolytic reaction (ABO incompatibility) presents with fever, chills, flank/back pain, hypotension, tachycardia, and potentially red urine. This is the most serious transfusion reaction. STOP immediately, maintain IV access, notify provider STAT, monitor UOP (renal failure risk).
</details>

<details>
<summary>4. How long can a unit of packed RBCs infuse?</summary>

**Answer**: Maximum 4 hours

**Rationale**: Blood products must not hang longer than 4 hours due to risk of bacterial growth and hemolysis at room temperature. If blood cannot be infused in 4 hours, it should be divided into smaller aliquots by blood bank.
</details>

<details>
<summary>5. Which blood type is considered the universal donor?</summary>

**Answer**: Type O negative

**Rationale**: Type O negative blood has no A, B, or Rh antigens on RBCs, so it can be given to any blood type in emergencies. Type AB positive is the universal recipient (no antibodies in plasma, so can receive any type).
</details>

<details>
<summary>6. Patient develops dyspnea, crackles, hypertension, and JVD during blood transfusion. What complication is this?</summary>

**Answer**: Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO)

**Rationale**: TACO (fluid overload) presents with respiratory distress, crackles, hypertension, bounding pulse, and JVD. Stop or slow transfusion, elevate HOB, give oxygen, notify provider, anticipate diuretics. This differs from TRALI which has normal CVP/blood pressure.
</details>

<details>
<summary>7. What must two nurses verify at the bedside before starting a blood transfusion?</summary>

**Answer**: Patient identity, blood type, unit number, and expiration date

**Rationale**: Two licensed nurses must verify at bedside: patient ID (2 identifiers), blood unit number matches paperwork, blood type matches, expiration date valid, blood inspected (no clots/discoloration). This critical safety check prevents fatal ABO incompatibility reactions.
</details>

<details>
<summary>8. Which patients require irradiated blood products?</summary>

**Answer**: Immunocompromised patients, including bone marrow transplant recipients

**Rationale**: Immunocompromised patients need irradiated blood to prevent transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Irradiation inactivates donor T-lymphocytes that could attack recipient tissues. Required for: bone marrow/stem cell transplant, Hodgkin's disease, congenital immunodeficiency.
</details>
