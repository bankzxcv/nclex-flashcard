## 👶 Erikson's Psychosocial Development Theory

### 8 Stages Across the Lifespan

Erik Erikson's theory focuses on psychosocial development through eight stages, each with a developmental crisis to resolve.

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ERIKSON'S 8 STAGES - NCLEX FAVORITE                   │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  1. Trust vs Mistrust (0-1 year)                       │
│  2. Autonomy vs Shame/Doubt (1-3 years)                │
│  3. Initiative vs Guilt (3-6 years)                    │
│  4. Industry vs Inferiority (6-12 years)               │
│  5. Identity vs Role Confusion (12-18 years)           │
│  6. Intimacy vs Isolation (Young adult)                │
│  7. Generativity vs Stagnation (Middle adult)          │
│  8. Integrity vs Despair (Older adult)                 │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## 🧩 Piaget's Cognitive Development Theory

### 4 Stages of Cognitive Development

Jean Piaget described how children develop thinking and reasoning abilities.

| Stage | Age | Key Characteristics | Nursing Implications |
|-------|-----|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Sensorimotor** | 0-2 years | • Object permanence develops<br>• Learns through senses<br>• "Out of sight, out of mind" | • Use consistent caregivers<br>• Provide sensory stimulation<br>• Allow comfort items |
| **Preoperational** | 2-7 years | • Egocentric thinking<br>• Magical thinking<br>• No concept of conservation<br>• Animism (inanimate objects alive) | • Use simple, literal explanations<br>• Avoid abstract concepts<br>• Use play therapy<br>• Correct misconceptions |
| **Concrete Operations** | 7-11 years | • Logical thinking about concrete events<br>• Understands conservation<br>• Can classify and organize | • Provide concrete examples<br>• Demonstrate procedures<br>• Allow questions |
| **Formal Operations** | 11+ years | • Abstract thinking<br>• Hypothetical reasoning<br>• Problem-solving<br>• Future planning | • Discuss hypothetical situations<br>• Involve in care decisions<br>• Explain rationale |

---

### Detailed Breakdown by Stage

#### Sensorimotor Stage (0-2 years)

**Object Permanence** (develops around 8-9 months):
- Understands objects exist even when not visible
- Before this: "Out of sight, out of mind"
- Plays peek-a-boo

**Stranger Anxiety** (8-12 months):
- Fear of unfamiliar people
- Normal developmental milestone
- Peaks around 8-9 months

**Separation Anxiety** (6-30 months):
- Distress when separated from caregiver
- Peaks 10-18 months
- Gradually decreases but may persist to age 3

**Nursing Care**:
```
HOSPITALIZATION OF INFANT
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ✓ Allow parent to room-in             │
│ ✓ Consistent nursing staff             │
│ ✓ Maintain home routines               │
│ ✓ Provide comfort items (blanket, toy) │
│ ✓ Minimize painful procedures          │
│ ✗ Separation from parents = traumatic  │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

#### Preoperational Stage (2-7 years)

**Egocentrism**:
- Believes everyone thinks like them
- Cannot see another's perspective
- "I'm hungry so everyone must be hungry"

**Magical Thinking**:
- Believes thoughts cause events
- May think illness is punishment
- "I was bad, so I got sick"

**Animism**:
- Believes inanimate objects are alive
- Talks to dolls, stuffed animals
- "The shot is mean"

**No Concept of Conservation**:
- Doesn't understand same amount can look different
- Tall thin glass has "more" than short wide glass

**Nursing Implications**:
```
CORRECTING MISCONCEPTIONS
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Child: "I got sick because I was bad"       │
│ Nurse: "You got sick because of germs,      │
│         not because you were bad"           │
│                                              │
│ Use simple, concrete language:              │
│ ✓ "The medicine will help your owie"       │
│ ✗ "The antibiotic will treat the infection" │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**NCLEX Key**: ALWAYS assess what preschooler thinks caused illness - correct magical thinking!

---

#### Concrete Operations Stage (7-11 years)

**Logical Thinking** (but only about concrete, tangible things):
- Can classify objects
- Understands cause and effect
- Can't yet think abstractly

**Conservation**:
- Understands amount stays same regardless of shape
- Can reverse operations mentally

**Nursing Implications**:
- Use concrete examples and demonstrations
- "Show and tell" approach

- Explain procedures step-by-step

---

#### Formal Operations Stage (11+ years to adult)

**Abstract Thinking**:
- Can think hypothetically
- Understands abstract concepts
- Problem-solving abilities
- Can consider multiple perspectives

**Adolescent Egocentrism** (paradoxically returns):
- **Imaginary audience**: Believes everyone is watching them
- **Personal fable**: Believes they're unique, invincible ("It won't happen to me")

**Nursing Implications**:
- Discuss long-term consequences
- Involve in complex care decisions
- Explain pathophysiology
- Respect privacy (imaginary audience)

## 🧬 Freud's Psychosexual Development

### 5 Stages (Brief Overview for NCLEX)

| Stage | Age | Focus | Key Point |
|-------|-----|-------|-----------|
| **Oral** | 0-1 year | Mouth | Sucking, feeding |
| **Anal** | 1-3 years | Bowel/bladder | Toilet training |

## ⚖️ Kohlberg's Moral Development Theory

### 3 Levels of Moral Reasoning

Lawrence Kohlberg described how moral reasoning develops.

#### Level 1: Preconventional (Birth - 9 years)

**Stage 1: Punishment-Obedience**
- Right = Avoiding punishment
- "I'll be good so I don't get in trouble"

**Stage 2: Instrumental-Relativist**
- Right = Personal benefit
- "I'll share so you'll share with me"

**NCLEX Application**: Young children need external controls (rules, consequences)

---

#### Level 2: Conventional (9-20 years)

**Stage 3: Good Boy-Nice Girl**
- Right = Pleasing others
- "I want others to think I'm good"

**Stage 4: Law and Order**
- Right = Following rules and laws
- "Rules are rules, must be followed"

**NCLEX Application**: School-age and adolescents understand rules and social expectations

---

#### Level 3: Postconventional (20+ years, if at all)

**Stage 5: Social Contract**
- Right = Agreed-upon rights
- "Laws can be changed if unjust"

**Stage 6: Universal Ethical Principles**
- Right = Internal ethical principles
- "I follow my conscience"

**NCLEX Application**: Not everyone reaches this level; adults may function at conventional level

## ✅ Practice Questions

<details>
<summary>Question 1: Which toy is most appropriate for a 6-month-old infant?</summary>

**Answer**: Soft, colorful toy that makes noise when shaken (rattle).

**Rationale**: 6-month-olds are in sensorimotor stage. They learn through senses - sight, sound, touch. Can grasp and bring objects to mouth. Toy should be safe to mouth, no small parts (choking), bright colors, interesting sounds. Can also transfer hand-to-hand at this age.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 2: A 2-year-old is hospitalized. Which nursing action best supports development?</summary>

**Answer**: Offer choices such as "Do you want to wear the red shirt or blue shirt?"

**Rationale**: Toddlers are in autonomy vs shame/doubt stage. They need to assert independence and make choices. Hospitalization threatens autonomy. Offering LIMITED choices (2 options) gives sense of control without being overwhelming. Promotes autonomy and cooperation.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 3: A 4-year-old is scheduled for surgery. Which explanation is best?</summary>

**Answer**: "The doctor will fix your tummy so it doesn't hurt anymore. You will go to sleep for a little while, then wake up and your parents will be there."

**Rationale**: Preschoolers are in preoperational stage - need simple, concrete, literal language. Avoid medical jargon and abstract concepts. Address magical thinking and fears (bodily injury, separation from parents). Reassure parents will be there. Keep explanations short and simple.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 4: An 8-year-old tells the nurse "I'm stupid because I can't do math like the other kids." This statement reflects which Erikson stage?</summary>

**Answer**: Industry vs Inferiority

**Rationale**: School-age children (6-12 years) are in industry vs inferiority stage. They develop competence through mastering skills. Failure or perceived failure leads to feelings of inferiority. Nurse should praise child's strengths, encourage effort, avoid comparisons to peers.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 5: Which statement by a 16-year-old indicates understanding of contraception teaching?</summary>

**Answer**: "I understand that condoms protect against STIs and pregnancy when used correctly."

**Rationale**: Adolescents are in formal operations stage - can understand abstract concepts and future consequences. Can comprehend complex health information. This response shows understanding of dual protection. Despite personal fable ("it won't happen to me"), education can be effective.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 6: A 9-month-old cries when the nurse approaches. What should the nurse do?</summary>

**Answer**: Ask the parent to hold the child during the assessment.

**Rationale**: 9-month-old experiencing normal stranger anxiety (develops 8-12 months). Child will be most comfortable with familiar caregiver. Having parent hold child during assessment reduces anxiety, supports trust, and facilitates exam. Trying to force interaction will increase distress.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 7: Which behavior is expected in a 3-year-old?</summary>

**Answer**: Plays alongside other children with similar toys (parallel play).

**Rationale**: Toddlers and young preschoolers engage in parallel play - play alongside but not interactively with peers. Cooperative play develops in later preschool years (4-5 years). This is normal developmental progression, not delayed social skills.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 8: A parent asks when to start toilet training. The child is 18 months old. What is the best response?</summary>

**Answer**: "Wait until your child shows signs of readiness such as staying dry for 2 hours and indicating the need to go."

**Rationale**: Toilet training requires physical and psychological readiness. Readiness signs: stays dry 2 hours, indicates need to go, can pull pants up/down, shows interest. Average readiness 18-24 months, but varies. Forcing before readiness causes shame and delays success. Autonomy stage - child must feel in control.
</details>
