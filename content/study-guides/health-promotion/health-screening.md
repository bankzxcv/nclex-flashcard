# Health Screening & Disease Prevention

## Overview

Health screening and disease prevention are cornerstones of health promotion across the lifespan. Understanding recommended screenings, immunization schedules, and preventive health measures is essential for NCLEX success and providing comprehensive patient care.

## 🎯 Levels of Prevention

### Three Levels: Primary, Secondary, Tertiary

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  LEVELS OF PREVENTION                                     │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  PRIMARY: Prevent disease before it occurs                │
│           - Immunizations                                 │
│           - Health education                              │
│           - Safety measures                               │
│                                                           │
│  SECONDARY: Early detection and treatment                │
│            - Screening tests                              │

### Vaccine Administration Principles

```
VACCINE SAFETY
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ BEFORE Administration:                           │
│ ✓ Screen for contraindications                  │
│ ✓ Check allergy history (egg, gelatin, neomycin)│
│ ✓ Assess for current illness                    │
│ ✓ Verify not pregnant (live vaccines)           │
│ ✓ Check immunization record                     │
│                                                  │

## 🔬 Cancer Screening Guidelines

### Breast Cancer Screening

#### Average Risk Women

| Age | Screening Recommendation |
|-----|-------------------------|
| **20-39** | Clinical breast exam every 1-3 years<br>Know what's normal for you |
| **40-44** | Option to start annual mammogram |
| **45-54** | Annual mammogram |
| **55+** | Mammogram every 1-2 years, continue as long as healthy |

**High-Risk Women** (BRCA mutation, strong family history):
- Start screening earlier (age 30 or 10 years before youngest affected relative)
- Annual mammogram + MRI
- Consider genetic counseling

**Clinical Breast Exam**: Every 1-3 years ages 20-39, annually age 40+

**Self-Breast Exam**:
- Optional (know what's normal)
- If done, monthly (1 week after menses)
- Report changes immediately

---

### Cervical Cancer Screening

| Age | Screening Recommendation |
|-----|-------------------------|
| **<21** | No screening (even if sexually active) |
| **21-29** | Pap smear every 3 years |
| **30-65** | Pap + HPV co-test every 5 years<br>OR Pap alone every 3 years |
| **65+** | Stop if adequate prior screening and not high risk |

**Stop Screening If**:
- Adequate prior negative screenings
- No high-risk history
- Hysterectomy with cervix removed (for benign reason)

**More Frequent Screening**:
- HIV positive
- Immunocompromised
- Previous abnormal results
- DES exposure in utero

---

### Colorectal Cancer Screening

**Start at age 45** for average risk (previously 50)

#### Options (Choose ONE):

**Stool-Based Tests**:
- **FIT** (Fecal Immunochemical Test): Annually
- **gFOBT** (guaiac Fecal Occult Blood Test): Annually
- **FIT-DNA**: Every 3 years

**Visual Exams**:
- **Colonoscopy**: Every 10 years (GOLD STANDARD)
- **Flexible sigmoidoscopy**: Every 5 years
- **CT colonography**: Every 5 years

**High-Risk Individuals** (family history, IBD, polyps):
- Start earlier (age 40 or 10 years before affected relative)
- More frequent screening

---

### Lung Cancer Screening

**Recommendations** (USPSTF 2021):

**Who**: Ages 50-80 with ALL of:
- 20+ pack-year smoking history
- Currently smoke OR quit within past 15 years
- No signs/symptoms of lung cancer

**Test**: Annual low-dose CT (LDCT)

**Stop When**:
- Age >80
- Quit smoking >15 years ago
- Unable to tolerate treatment

**Pack-Years Calculation**: Packs per day × Years smoked
- Example: 1 pack/day × 20 years = 20 pack-years
- Example: 2 packs/day × 10 years = 20 pack-years

---

### Prostate Cancer Screening

**Controversy**: Screening benefits vs harms unclear

**Shared Decision-Making Approach**:

| Age | Recommendation |
|-----|---------------|
| **50-69** | Discuss PSA screening<br>Individual decision based on preferences |
| **45-49** | Consider if African American or family history |
| **70+** | Generally NOT recommended |

**PSA (Prostate-Specific Antigen)**:
- Blood test
- Elevated can indicate cancer, BPH, prostatitis, or other conditions
- False positives common

**DRE (Digital Rectal Exam)**:
- Palpate prostate for nodules, enlargement

**NCLEX Tip**: Prostate screening is controversial - teach patient to discuss risks/benefits with provider

---

### Skin Cancer Screening

**Self-Examination**: Monthly

**ABCDE Rule for Melanoma**:
```
A - Asymmetry (one half unlike other)
B - Border irregular (notched, scalloped)
C - Color varied (shades of brown, black, red, white, blue)

## 📝 Practice Questions

<details>
<summary>Question 1: A pregnant woman asks if she should get the flu vaccine. What is the best response?</summary>

**Answer**: "Yes, the flu vaccine is recommended during any trimester of pregnancy."

**Rationale**: Influenza vaccination is recommended for all pregnant women during flu season, any trimester. Protects mother and provides passive immunity to infant. Use inactivated vaccine (injection), NOT live nasal spray. Pregnant women are at higher risk for flu complications.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 2: Which patient needs pneumococcal vaccine?</summary>

**Answer**: 68-year-old with no previous pneumococcal vaccination.

**Rationale**: All adults age 65+ should receive pneumococcal vaccine (PCV15/PCV20 or combination). Protects against pneumonia, meningitis, sepsis. Also recommended for younger adults with certain conditions (immunocompromise, chronic lung/heart disease, diabetes, etc.).
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 3: A 50-year-old woman asks when she should start mammograms. What should the nurse recommend?</summary>

**Answer**: Discuss options - can start now with annual mammograms or wait until 45.

**Rationale**: Current guidelines allow women to start mammograms at age 40 if desired, or wait until 45. Ages 40-44 = optional, 45-54 = annual recommended, 55+ = every 1-2 years. Discuss individual risk factors, preferences, and benefits vs risks.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 4: Which is an example of primary prevention?</summary>

**Answer**: Teaching proper hand hygiene to prevent infection.

**Rationale**: Primary prevention prevents disease before it occurs. Examples: immunizations, health education, safety measures, healthy lifestyle. Secondary = early detection (screening). Tertiary = reduce complications of existing disease (rehab).
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 5: A parent asks about MMR vaccine. The child had a cold yesterday but is better today. What should the nurse do?</summary>

**Answer**: Administer the MMR vaccine as scheduled.

**Rationale**: Minor illness (cold, low-grade fever, mild diarrhea) is NOT a contraindication to vaccination. Vaccine can be given safely. True contraindications include severe allergic reaction, severe immunodeficiency, pregnancy (MMR is live). Delaying for minor illness decreases immunization rates unnecessarily.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 6: A 60-year-old asks about colonoscopy. He has no symptoms and average risk. What should the nurse recommend?</summary>

**Answer**: "Colonoscopy is recommended every 10 years starting at age 45 for average risk individuals."

**Rationale**: Colorectal cancer screening starts at age 45 (updated from 50). Colonoscopy every 10 years is gold standard. Other options: annual FIT, flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years. Patient is due for first screening (age 60, no prior screening). Earlier and more frequent if family history or symptoms.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 7: Which statement about Pap smears is correct?</summary>

**Answer**: "Women can stop Pap smears at age 65 if they have had adequate prior negative screenings."

**Rationale**: Cervical cancer screening recommendations: Start age 21, Pap every 3 years (21-29), Pap + HPV every 5 years (30-65). Can stop at 65 if adequate prior negative screens and not high risk. Do NOT screen <21 even if sexually active. Continue screening after hysterectomy if cervix intact or history of cervical dysplasia.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 8: A patient asks about skin cancer prevention. What is the most important teaching?</summary>

**Answer**: "Use broad-spectrum sunscreen SPF 30+ and avoid tanning beds."

**Rationale**: Sun protection is key primary prevention for skin cancer. Use sunscreen SPF 30+, reapply every 2 hours, seek shade during peak hours (10am-4pm), wear protective clothing and hats, avoid tanning beds. Teach ABCDE signs of melanoma. Monthly self-skin checks. Annual professional exam if high risk.
