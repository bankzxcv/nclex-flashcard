# Ethical Practice in Nursing

## Overview

Ethical practice is the foundation of professional nursing. Understanding ethical principles, theories, and frameworks is essential for navigating complex clinical situations and is heavily tested on the NCLEX.

---

## 🌟 Core Ethical Principles

### 1. Autonomy

**Definition**: Right of self-determination; patients make their own healthcare decisions

**In Practice:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  AUTONOMY EXAMPLES:                                  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  ✓ Patient chooses whether to have surgery          │
│  ✓ Patient refuses chemotherapy                      │
│  ✓ Patient decides to leave AMA                      │
│  ✓ Patient creates advance directive                 │
│  ✓ Patient participates in care planning             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Nursing Implications:**
- Provide information so patient can make informed decisions
- Respect patient's choices even if you disagree
- Support patient's right to refuse treatment
- Ensure consent is truly voluntary

**Limitations:**
- Must be competent to exercise autonomy
- Cannot harm others
- Public health may override (e.g., mandatory quarantine)

---

### 2. Beneficence

**Definition**: Act in the patient's best interest; do good

**In Practice:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  BENEFICENCE EXAMPLES:                               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  ✓ Administering pain medication                     │
│  ✓ Educating patient about disease management        │
│  ✓ Repositioning patient to prevent pressure ulcers  │
│  ✓ Advocating for appropriate resources              │
│  ✓ Using evidence-based practices                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Nursing Implications:**
- Use current evidence-based practice
- Continue professional development
- Act with competence and skill
- Promote patient's well-being

**Key Point**: "Best interest" is defined by PATIENT, not healthcare provider

---

### 3. Non-Maleficence

**Definition**: "Do no harm" - avoid actions that cause harm

**In Practice:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  NON-MALEFICENCE EXAMPLES:                           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  ✓ Check allergies before giving medication          │
│  ✓ Verify orders that seem incorrect                 │
│  ✓ Use proper technique to prevent infection         │
│  ✓ Maintain safe environment                         │
│  ✓ Report errors and near-misses                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Nursing Implications:**
- Practice within scope of practice
- Know limits of competence - ask for help
- Follow safety protocols
- Speak up about unsafe conditions
- Never perform procedures you're not trained for

**Balance**: Sometimes treatment causes temporary harm for greater good (e.g., chemotherapy side effects)

---

### 4. Justice

**Definition**: Fairness and equality in distribution of healthcare resources

**In Practice:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  JUSTICE EXAMPLES:                                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  ✓ Treat all patients equally regardless of ability  │
│    to pay, race, religion, lifestyle                 │
│  ✓ Allocate nursing time fairly among patients       │
│  ✓ Provide interpreter services to all who need them │
│  ✓ Advocate for underserved populations              │
│  ✓ Fair allocation of scarce resources               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Types of Justice:**

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Distributive** | Fair distribution of resources | Organ transplant allocation |
| **Procedural** | Fair processes and rules | Same admission criteria for all |
| **Compensatory** | Make amends for wrongdoing | Compensation for medical error |

---

### 5. Fidelity

**Definition**: Faithfulness; keeping promises and commitments

**In Practice:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  FIDELITY EXAMPLES:                                  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  ✓ Following through when you say you'll do something│
│  ✓ Returning to check on patient as promised         │
│  ✓ Maintaining confidentiality                       │
│  ✓ Honoring commitments to patients                  │
│  ✓ Being trustworthy and dependable                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Nursing Implications:**
- Build trust through consistent actions
- Keep promises to patients
- Maintain professional boundaries
- Honor confidentiality agreements

---

### 6. Veracity

**Definition**: Truthfulness; duty to tell the truth

**In Practice:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  VERACITY EXAMPLES:                                  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  ✓ Honest answers to patient questions               │
│  ✓ Accurate documentation                            │
│  ✓ Admitting errors                                  │
│  ✓ Providing truthful information about prognosis    │
│  ✓ Being honest about your knowledge/limitations     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Nursing Implications:**
- Never lie to patients
- If you don't know, say so and find out
- Document accurately and factually
- Report errors honestly

**Therapeutic Exception**: In rare cases, may withhold information if disclosure would cause serious harm (requires careful ethical analysis)

## ⚖️ Ethical Decision-Making Frameworks

### Ethical Decision-Making Model

```
STEP 1: IDENTIFY THE ETHICAL ISSUE
        ↓
        Is this a legal, ethical, or clinical issue?
        What are the competing values?

STEP 2: GATHER INFORMATION
        ↓
        • Medical facts
        • Patient's wishes/values
        • Family input
        • Legal requirements
        • Institutional policies

STEP 3: IDENTIFY STAKEHOLDERS
        ↓
        • Patient
        • Family
        • Healthcare team
        • Institution
        • Society

STEP 4: IDENTIFY OPTIONS
        ↓
        • What are all possible courses of action?
        • What are consequences of each?

STEP 5: APPLY ETHICAL PRINCIPLES
        ↓
        • Which principles support each option?
        • Which principles are in conflict?

STEP 6: MAKE A DECISION
        ↓
        • Choose best option based on ethical analysis
        • Can you defend this decision?

STEP 7: EVALUATE THE OUTCOME
        ↓
        • What happened?
        • Would you do it differently next time?
```

## 🏥 Common Ethical Dilemmas in Nursing

### Dilemma 1: End-of-Life Care

**Scenario**: Family wants "everything done" but patient has terminal cancer and DNR

**Ethical Conflict**:
- Autonomy (patient's wishes) vs. Family's wishes
- Non-maleficence (avoid suffering) vs. Beneficence (family thinks aggressive care is beneficial)

**Resolution Framework**:
1. Patient's advance directive takes priority (Autonomy)
2. Educate family about patient's wishes
3. Explain DNR doesn't mean "do nothing"
4. Offer palliative care and comfort measures
5. Provide emotional support to family
6. Ethics committee consultation if needed

---

### Dilemma 2: Substance Abuse in Pregnancy

**Scenario**: Pregnant patient admits to using heroin

**Ethical Conflict**:
- Patient's autonomy vs. Fetal well-being
- Non-maleficence (harm to fetus) vs. Confidentiality
- Justice (resources for mother) vs. Fetal rights

**Resolution Framework**:
1. Non-judgmental care for mother (patient is the patient)
2. Education about risks to fetus
3. Connect with addiction services, prenatal care
4. Mandatory reporting if state law requires
5. Focus on harm reduction
6. Support, not punishment

---

### Dilemma 3: Resource Allocation

**Scenario**: Pandemic - limited ventilators, must decide who gets one

**Ethical Conflict**:
- Justice (fair allocation) vs. Individual needs
- Beneficence (maximize lives saved) vs. Individual patient care
- Various allocation criteria in conflict

**Allocation Criteria** (vary by institution):
- Medical prognosis/likelihood of survival
- Organ system function
- Sequential (first come, first served)
- Random (lottery)
- Social worth (controversial - generally NOT used)

**Resolution**: Follow institutional protocol and triage criteria

---

### Dilemma 4: Impaired Colleague

**Scenario**: Nurse suspects coworker is diverting narcotics and working while impaired

**Ethical Conflict**:
- Loyalty to colleague vs. Patient safety
- Fidelity (to nursing profession) vs. Beneficence (help colleague)

**Resolution**:
1. **Patient safety is priority** - never ignore
2. Document specific observations (slurred speech, patients reporting ineffective pain medication)
3. Report to supervisor immediately
4. Follow institutional policy
5. May report to Board of Nursing
6. Helping colleague = getting them help, not covering up

**Remember**: Reporting impaired colleague IS advocacy - for patients and the colleague

---

## 🚨 Ethical Issues in Special Situations

### Organ Donation & Transplantation

**Ethical Principles**:
- Justice: Fair allocation of scarce organs
- Autonomy: Donor consent
- Non-maleficence: Verify death before organ recovery
- Transparency: Clear allocation criteria

**UNOS Allocation Criteria**:
1. Medical urgency
2. Tissue match
3. Time on waiting list
4. Geographic location

**Nursing Role**:
- Support family during decision
- Separate organ donation discussion from death notification (different people)
- Never pressure family
- Maintain care of donor with respect

---

### Confidentiality vs. Duty to Warn

**Scenario**: Patient tells nurse he plans to harm specific person

**Tarasoff Principle**: Duty to warn identified victim may override confidentiality

**When Duty to Warn Applies**:
- Specific, credible threat
- Identifiable victim
- Imminent danger

**Action**:
1. Notify intended victim
2. Notify police
3. Document
4. Follow institutional protocol

**Balance**: Maintain confidentiality unless clear danger exists

---

### Genetic Testing & Privacy

**Ethical Issues**:
- Right NOT to know genetic information
- Disclosure to family members (can affect their health decisions)
- Insurance/employment discrimination
- Privacy of genetic information

**GINA (Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act)**:
- Protects against health insurance and employment discrimination
- Does NOT cover life insurance, disability insurance, long-term care

**Nursing Implications**:
- Genetic counseling before testing
- Ensure informed consent
- Protect genetic information
- Support patient's decision to test or not

---

### Cultural Practices vs. Medical Recommendations

**Scenario**: Family's cultural practices conflict with medical treatment

**Examples**:
- Hmong family wants to take placenta home (biohazard)
- Muslim family requests same-gender caregivers
- Jehovah's Witness refuses blood transfusion
- Traditional healers in hospital room

**Approach**:
1. **Cultural humility** - learn about patient's culture
2. **Explore accommodations** - can we honor both?
3. **Negotiate** - find middle ground when possible
4. **Respect** - when safe, honor cultural practices
5. **Ethics committee** - if significant conflict

**Balance**: Respect culture while maintaining safety

---

## 🎯 Ethics Committee

### When to Consult Ethics Committee

- Conflict about treatment decisions
- Disagreement between patient/family/team
- End-of-life decision making
- Resource allocation issues
- Questions about decision-making capacity
- Cultural or religious conflicts
- Research ethics questions

### What Ethics Committee Does

**NOT a decision-making body** - provides:
- Ethical analysis of situation
- Education about ethical principles
- Mediation between parties
- Recommendations (not binding)
- Support for healthcare team

**Outcomes**:
- Clarify ethical issues
- Facilitate communication
- Identify options
- Support difficult decisions
