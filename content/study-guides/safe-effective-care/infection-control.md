# Infection Control & Asepsis

## Overview
Infection prevention and control is a critical nursing responsibility and heavily tested on the NCLEX. Understanding the chain of infection, aseptic techniques, and isolation precautions is essential for safe patient care.

---

## 🔗 Chain of Infection

Breaking any link in the chain stops infection transmission:

```
1. Infectious Agent → 2. Reservoir → 3. Portal of Exit →
4. Mode of Transmission → 5. Portal of Entry → 6. Susceptible Host
```

### 1. Infectious Agent
- **Bacteria**: Staphylococcus, E. coli, C. diff
- **Viruses**: Influenza, HIV, Hepatitis
- **Fungi**: Candida, Aspergillus
- **Parasites**: Malaria, Giardia

### 2. Reservoir (Where pathogen lives)
- Humans, animals, environment
- **Nursing intervention**: Proper waste disposal, environmental cleaning

### 3. Portal of Exit
- Respiratory tract (coughing, sneezing)
- GI tract (feces, vomitus)
- Blood/body fluids
- Skin/mucous membranes
- **Nursing intervention**: Cover nose/mouth when coughing, proper wound care

### 4. Mode of Transmission
- **Contact** (direct or indirect)
- **Droplet** (within 3 feet)
- **Airborne** (suspended in air)
- **Vector** (insects, animals)
- **Nursing intervention**: Hand hygiene, PPE, isolation precautions

### 5. Portal of Entry
- Same routes as exit
- **Nursing intervention**: Aseptic technique, intact skin, sterile procedures

### 6. Susceptible Host
- Immunocompromised, very young/old, chronic illness
- **Nursing intervention**: Nutrition, immunizations, avoid unnecessary invasive procedures

## 🧼 Hand Hygiene

### The MOST Important Infection Control Measure

**When to perform hand hygiene**:
- Before and after patient contact
- Before aseptic procedures
- After body fluid exposure risk
- After touching patient surroundings
- Before eating
- After using restroom

### Soap and Water vs. Alcohol-Based Hand Rub

| Use Soap & Water When: | Alcohol-Based Rub OK When: |
|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Hands visibly soiled | Hands not visibly dirty |
| **C. difficile** exposure | Routine patient care |
| Before eating | Between patients |
| After restroom | After removing gloves |
| **Spore-forming organisms** | Most situations |

**Important**: Alcohol does NOT kill C. diff spores or norovirus. Must use soap and water!

### Proper Handwashing Technique
1. Wet hands with warm water
2. Apply soap
3. Lather for **at least 20 seconds** (sing "Happy Birthday" twice)
4. Scrub all surfaces, between fingers, under nails
5. Rinse thoroughly
6. Dry with paper towel
7. Use paper towel to turn off faucet

## 🦠 Standard Precautions

### Apply to ALL Patients, ALL Times

Assume all blood and body fluids are potentially infectious.

### Body Fluids Requiring Precautions
- Blood
- All body fluids, secretions, excretions (except sweat)
- Non-intact skin
- Mucous membranes

### PPE Selection Based on Anticipated Exposure

| Activity | Gloves | Gown | Mask | Eye Protection |
|----------|--------|------|------|----------------|
| Bathing | ✓ | If soiling likely | ✗ | ✗ |
| Suctioning | ✓ | If soiling likely | ✓ | ✓ |
| Wound care | ✓ | If soiling likely | ✗ | ✗ |
| Starting IV | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Emptying bedpan | ✓ | If soiling likely | ✗ | ✗ |

### PPE Donning (Putting On) Order
1. **Gown** (ties in back)
2. **Mask/Respirator** (secure ties/elastic)
3. **Goggles/Face Shield** (adjust to fit)
4. **Gloves** (cover gown cuffs)

### PPE Doffing (Removing) Order
**Most contaminated items removed first!**

1. **Gloves** (peel off, inside out)
2. **Goggles/Face Shield** (handle by headband only)
3. **Gown** (unfasten, roll inside out)
4. **Mask** (remove by ties only, don't touch front)
5. **HAND HYGIENE** immediately after removal

## 🏥 Isolation Precautions Summary Table

|------|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Standard** | No | If splashing risk | ALL patients |
| **Contact** | Yes (preferred) | No (unless droplet too) | MRSA, VRE, C. diff |

## 🧪 Aseptic Technique

### Medical Asepsis ("Clean Technique")
- Reduces number of microorganisms
- Prevents transmission
- Used in most patient care activities
- Examples: Hand hygiene, clean gloves, clean equipment

### Surgical Asepsis ("Sterile Technique")
- **Eliminates ALL** microorganisms
- Used for invasive procedures
- Examples: Surgery, catheter insertion, wound care

### Sterile Field Principles

**A sterile object remains sterile only when touched by another sterile object**

Rules:
1. **Sterile touches sterile** = Sterile
2. **Sterile touches unsterile** = Contaminated
3. **Edge (1 inch) of sterile field** = Unsterile
4. **Hold sterile items above waist** level
5. **Never turn back** on sterile field
6. **Never reach across** sterile field
7. **Wet sterile field** = Contaminated (strike-through)
8. **Doubt sterility?** = Consider contaminated

### Opening Sterile Packages
- Open **flap away** from you first
- Open **side flaps** next (don't reach across)
- Open **final flap toward** you last

## 💉 Preventing Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAIs)

### Catheter-Associated UTI (CAUTI)
**Prevention**:
- Insert only when necessary
- Maintain closed drainage system
- Keep bag below bladder level
- Daily perineal care
- Remove as soon as possible

### Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infection (CLABSI)
**Prevention**:
- Strict sterile technique during insertion
- Daily chlorhexidine bath
- Assess need daily
- Change dressing per protocol
- Scrub hub before accessing line

### Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP)
**Prevention**:
- Elevate head of bed 30-45°
- Oral care with chlorhexidine every 2 hours
- Suction subglottic secretions
- Daily sedation vacation
- Assess readiness to wean daily

### Surgical Site Infection (SSI)
**Prevention**:
- Preoperative antibiotics (within 1 hour of incision)
- Clipper (not razor) for hair removal
- Maintain normothermia
- Glucose control
- Sterile technique during dressing changes

## 🧴 Cleaning, Disinfection, and Sterilization

| Level | Method | Use | Examples |
|-------|--------|-----|----------|
| **Cleaning** | Soap & water | Remove debris | Washing hands, patient bathing |
| **Disinfection** | Chemical agents | Kill most pathogens | Cleaning surfaces, equipment |
| **Sterilization** | Heat, gas, radiation | Kill ALL microorganisms | Surgical instruments |

## 🩺 NCLEX Tips

### High-Yield Testing Points

1. **Hand hygiene** is always the answer for "best way to prevent infection"
2. **N95 for airborne** (TB, measles, varicella), **surgical mask for droplet**
3. **C. diff requires soap and water**, not alcohol-based hand rub
4. **Remove most contaminated PPE first** (gloves)
5. **Private room** required for airborne precautions
6. **Negative pressure room** for airborne, **positive pressure** for neutropenic patients
7. When in doubt about isolation type, **choose the most protective**

### Common NCLEX Scenarios

**Scenario**: Which patient can share a room?
- **Correct**: Two patients with SAME infection
- **Incorrect**: Different infections, immunocompromised with any infection

**Scenario**: Nurse forgot to perform hand hygiene. What is priority?
- **Answer**: Perform hand hygiene immediately

**Scenario**: Which task can be delegated to UAP?
- **Can delegate**: Vital signs, bathing (with proper PPE training)
- **Cannot delegate**: Assessment, sterile procedures, patient teaching
