## ⚖️ Right to Refuse Treatment

### Key Principles

**Competent adult patients have the ABSOLUTE right to refuse any treatment**, including:

- Blood transfusions
- Life-saving treatment

### Requirements for Valid Refusal

```
PATIENT MUST:
  ✓ Be competent/have decision-making capacity
  ✓ Be informed of consequences of refusal
  ✓ Make voluntary decision (no coercion)
```

### Nursing Actions When Patient Refuses

**Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Assess understanding**
   - "Can you tell me why you're refusing?"
   - "What do you understand about this treatment?"

2. **Ensure informed decision**
   - Verify patient understands consequences
   - Notify physician if patient needs more info
   - Don't assume refusal means lack of understanding

3. **Support the decision**
   - Respect patient's autonomy
   - Don't pressure, coerce, or guilt-trip
   - Continue to provide care

4. **Document thoroughly**
   - Patient's statement of refusal
   - Patient's understanding of consequences
   - Education provided
   - Physician notification
   - Patient's signature on refusal form

5. **Continue to offer**
   - Patient can change mind anytime
   - Offer treatment at later time
   - Maintain therapeutic relationship

**If Patient is Minor:**
- Parents can refuse for themselves
- Courts may intervene if child's life at risk
- Emergency: court order may authorize transfusion
- Ethics committee consultation

#### Against Medical Advice (AMA)

**Definition**: Patient leaves healthcare facility before medically recommended

**Nursing Actions:**
1. Notify physician immediately
2. Explain risks of leaving (document)
3. Try to persuade patient to stay (but don't coerce)
4. If patient still wants to leave:
   - Have patient sign AMA form
