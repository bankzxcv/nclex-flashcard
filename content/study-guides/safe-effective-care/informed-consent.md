## 👨‍⚕️ Who Obtains Informed Consent?

### Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| **Physician/Provider** | Obtains informed consent<br>Explains procedure, risks, benefits, alternatives<br>Answers medical questions<br>Signs consent form |
| **Nurse** | **Witnesses** signature<br>Verifies patient identity<br>Confirms patient is willing to sign<br>Advocates if patient has questions<br>**Does NOT obtain consent for procedures** |
| **Patient** | Asks questions<br>Makes decision<br>Signs consent form |

### Critical Distinction

```
❌ NURSE DOES NOT:
   • Explain surgical procedures
   • Obtain consent for procedures physician will perform
   • Answer medical questions about surgery

✓ NURSE DOES:
   • Witness patient's signature
   • Verify patient is signing voluntarily
   • Assess if patient understands
   • Contact physician if patient has questions
   • Advocate for patient
   • Obtain consent for NURSING procedures (IV, catheter, etc.)
```

---

## 🩺 What Requires Informed Consent?

### Procedures Requiring Written Informed Consent

- Surgical procedures
- Anesthesia
- Invasive diagnostic tests (biopsy, endoscopy, cardiac catheterization)
- Blood transfusions
- Experimental treatments or research participation
- High-risk procedures
- Procedures with significant risks

### Nursing Procedures (May Require Consent)

**Usually IMPLIED consent**:
- Vital signs
- Oral medications
- Routine care

**May require EXPLICIT consent**:
- IV insertion
- Catheterization
- Injections (patient can refuse)
- Physical examination

**Good Practice**: Explain ALL procedures and obtain verbal permission

---

## 🚫 When Consent is NOT Required

### Emergency Exception

**Criteria**:
1. Life-threatening emergency
2. Patient unable to consent
3. No authorized decision-maker available
4. Delay would cause serious harm/death

**Rationale**: Presumed consent - reasonable person would want life-saving treatment

**Example**: Unconscious patient brought to ED after car accident → Emergency surgery proceeds without consent

---

### Implied Consent

**Definition**: Patient's actions imply consent

**Examples**:
- Patient rolls up sleeve for blood pressure
- Patient opens mouth for oral medication
- Patient extends arm for blood draw

**Note**: Patient can still refuse at any time

---

## 👤 Who Can Give Informed Consent?

### Adults (18+ years)

**Competent Adults**: Can consent for themselves

**Requirements**:
- 18 years or older (in most states)
- Mentally competent
- Not under influence of medications/substances affecting judgment

---

### Minors (Under 18 years)

**General Rule**: Parent or legal guardian consents

**EXCEPTIONS - Minors Who Can Consent for Themselves:**

```
EMANCIPATED MINORS:
  ✓ Married
  ✓ In military
  ✓ Financially independent and living apart from parents
  ✓ Court-declared emancipated

MATURE MINOR DOCTRINE (varies by state):
  ✓ STI/STD testing and treatment
  ✓ Contraception
  ✓ Prenatal care
  ✓ Substance abuse treatment

```

**Emergency**: Life-threatening emergency → treat without parental consent

---

### Special Situations

#### Married Person

- Cannot consent for spouse

#### Unconscious/Incapacitated Patient
- Healthcare proxy/power of attorney
- Legal guardian
- Next of kin (order varies by state)

- Mental illness ≠ incompetent
- Assess decision-making capacity
- If involuntarily committed, may have limited rights

#### Intoxicated Patient
- Cannot give valid consent if impaired
- Wait until sober (if not emergency)
- Emergency exception if life-threatening

---

## 🎯 Nurse's Role in Informed Consent

### Before Procedure

**Assessment - The Nurse's CRITICAL Role**:

```
ASK THE PATIENT:
  "Can you tell me what procedure you're having?"
  "What did the doctor tell you about the risks?"
  "Do you have any questions?"

ASSESS FOR:
  ✓ Patient understanding
  ✓ Patient has questions
  ✓ Patient seems uncertain or confused
  ✓ Patient expresses concerns
  ✓ Consent seems coerced
  ✓ Patient appears impaired
```

### If Patient Has Questions or Doesn't Understand

**DO:**
1. ✓ **STOP the process**
2. ✓ Tell patient "I'll get the doctor to answer your questions"
3. ✓ **Notify physician immediately**
4. ✓ **Do NOT send patient to procedure**
5. ✓ Document patient's concerns and physician notification

**DO NOT:**
- ✗ Answer medical questions about the procedure
- ✗ Try to convince patient to sign
- ✗ Send patient to procedure anyway
- ✗ Tell patient "just sign, the doctor will answer questions later"

---

### Witnessing Signature

**As a Witness, You Verify**:
- Patient's identity (check ID band)
- Patient signed voluntarily
- Patient was conscious and oriented
- Patient appeared to understand

**You DO NOT verify**:
- That patient understands all risks
- That all information was provided
- Medical accuracy of information

**Documentation**: Sign as witness with credentials and time

---

## 🚨 Consent Issues - Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Patient States They Don't Understand

**Patient**: "I'm not sure what they're going to do in surgery."

**Nurse Action**:
```
✓ STOP the consent process
✓ "I'll contact Dr. [Name] to explain the procedure to you."
✓ Notify physician immediately
✓ Document: "Patient stated 'I'm not sure what they're going to do
             in surgery.' Dr. [Name] notified at [time]."
✓ Do NOT send to procedure until physician re-explains
```

---

### Scenario 2: Family Pressure

**Family**: "Dad, you need to sign this consent. The doctor knows what's best."

**Nurse Action**:
```
✓ Speak with patient privately
✓ "Mr. Smith, do YOU want to have this procedure?"
✓ Assess for coercion
✓ Ensure decision is patient's, not family's
✓ Support patient's autonomous decision
```

---

### Scenario 3: Patient Received Pre-op Medication

**Situation**: Patient already received sedating pre-op medication, consent not signed

**Nurse Action**:
```
✗ CANNOT obtain consent after sedating medication given
✓ Consent should have been obtained BEFORE sedation
✓ Notify physician immediately
✓ Procedure may need to be delayed
```

**Prevention**: Always verify consent BEFORE administering pre-op medications

---

### Scenario 4: Language Barrier

**Patient speaks only Spanish**, consent form in English

**Nurse Action**:
```
✓ Professional medical interpreter REQUIRED
✓ Use telephone interpretation if in-person unavailable
✓ Consent form should be in patient's language
✓ Family members should NOT interpret consent

✗ NEVER use:
   - Family members (conflict of interest)
   - Minor children
   - Untrained staff
   - Google Translate for consent
```

---

### Scenario 5: Patient Changes Mind

**Patient**: "I don't want the surgery anymore. I want to go home."

**Nurse Action**:
```
✓ Patient has RIGHT to withdraw consent anytime
✓ Notify physician immediately
✓ Support patient's decision
✓ Do NOT pressure or coerce
✓ Document withdrawal of consent
✓ Have patient sign refusal/AMA form if leaving
```

**Remember**: Consent can be withdrawn at ANY time before procedure

---

## 📄 Consent Forms

### Types of Consent

**General/Blanket Consent** (at admission):
- General hospital care
- Routine procedures (vital signs, basic care)
- NOT sufficient for surgery or invasive procedures

**Specific/Special Consent**:
- Specific procedure named
- Risks and benefits listed
- Alternatives noted
- More detailed

---

### Required Information on Consent Form

```
CONSENT FORM MUST INCLUDE:

✓ Patient's name
✓ Specific procedure/treatment (not "surgery" - name exact procedure)
✓ Name of physician performing procedure
✓ Statement that risks/benefits/alternatives were explained
✓ Patient signature and date/time
✓ Witness signature
✓ Interpreter signature (if applicable)
```

---

## ⚖️ Legal Considerations

### Informed Consent is:

**LEGAL Document**:
- Protects patient rights
- Protects healthcare providers from liability
- Evidence of patient's agreement

**ETHICAL Requirement**:
- Respects autonomy
- Upholds patient's right to self-determination
- Ensures patient participation in care

---

### Liability Issues

**Consent NOT obtained or invalid** → **Battery** (unauthorized touching)

**Provider performs different procedure than consented** → **Assault and battery**

**Inadequate information provided** → **Negligence/malpractice**

**Nurse's Liability**:
- Sending patient to procedure when consent issues identified
- Not advocating when patient has questions
- Obtaining consent for procedures outside scope of practice

---

## 🧠 Decision-Making Capacity Assessment

### When to Assess Capacity

**Assess if patient**:
- Is confused or disoriented
- Has received sedating medications
- Has mental illness or dementia
- Is intoxicated
- Seems to have impaired judgment
- Is in severe pain or distress

---

### Four Components of Capacity

```
PATIENT DEMONSTRATES CAPACITY BY:

1. UNDERSTANDING
   Can patient explain what they were told?
   "Can you tell me what the doctor said about this procedure?"

2. APPRECIATION
   Does patient understand how it applies to them?
   "How do you think this will affect you?"

3. REASONING
   Can patient weigh risks vs benefits?
   "What makes you want to have/not have this done?"

4. EXPRESSION
   Can patient clearly communicate a choice?
   "What have you decided to do?"
```

**If Lacks Capacity**: Cannot provide valid consent; need authorized decision-maker

---

## 🔑 Key NCLEX Concepts

### Mnemonic: **INFORMED**

- **I**dentify that physician obtains consent (not nurse)
- **N**otify physician if patient has questions
- **F**ree from coercion (voluntary decision)
- **O**riented and competent
- **R**isks, benefits, alternatives explained
- **M**inors need parent/guardian (except emancipated)
- **E**mergency exception exists
- **D**ocument concerns and notifications

---

## 💡 NCLEX Success Tips

### High-Yield Facts

1. **Physician obtains consent** - Nurse witnesses
2. **If patient has questions** → STOP and call physician
3. **Patient can withdraw consent** anytime before procedure
4. **Cannot consent after sedating medication** given
5. **Emancipated minors** can consent for themselves
6. **Emergency exception** - treat without consent if life-threatening
7. **Use professional interpreter** for non-English speakers
8. **Battery = performing procedure without consent**

---

### Common NCLEX Question Stems

**"What should the nurse do FIRST?"**
- Assess patient's understanding
- If patient has questions → notify physician

**"Patient says they have questions about surgery scheduled in 1 hour"**
- Notify surgeon immediately
- Do NOT send to OR until questions answered

**"Who can give consent for 17-year-old for surgery?"**
- Parent/legal guardian (unless emancipated)

**"What indicates informed consent is valid?"**
- Patient can explain procedure in own words

---

## 📝 Practice Questions

<details>
<summary>Question 1: Patient scheduled for surgery says "What exactly are they going to do?" What should the nurse do FIRST?</summary>

**Answer**: Notify the surgeon that patient has questions about the procedure.

**Rationale**: Patient's question indicates lack of understanding. Physician is responsible for explaining the procedure. Nurse should STOP process and notify surgeon. Do NOT send patient to surgery until questions are answered.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 2: A 16-year-old pregnant teen needs a cesarean section. Who should sign the consent?</summary>

**Answer**: The pregnant teen can sign her own consent.

**Rationale**: Pregnant minors are considered emancipated in most states and can consent for their own care and their baby's care. Do NOT need parental consent.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 3: Nurse is about to witness consent when patient says "My family wants me to have this surgery." What should the nurse do?</summary>

**Answer**: Speak with patient privately to ensure decision is voluntary.

**Rationale**: Consent must be voluntary. Patient's statement suggests possible coercion. Assess patient's own wishes privately. Patient may be signing to please family rather than own choice.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 4: Patient received pre-op sedation. Surgeon brings consent form to sign. What should the nurse do?</summary>

**Answer**: Inform surgeon that consent should have been obtained before sedation.

**Rationale**: Sedating medication impairs decision-making capacity. Cannot obtain valid consent after sedation. Consent must be obtained BEFORE pre-op medications. Procedure may need to be delayed.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 5: Unconscious patient needs emergency surgery to stop internal bleeding. Family cannot be reached. What should the nurse do?</summary>

**Answer**: Surgery can proceed based on emergency exception to consent.

**Rationale**: Life-threatening emergency + unable to obtain consent + delay would cause serious harm = emergency exception applies. Presumed consent - reasonable person would want life-saving treatment.
</details>
