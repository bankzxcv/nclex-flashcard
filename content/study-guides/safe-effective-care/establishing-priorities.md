# Establishing Priorities

## Overview

Priority-setting is one of the most critical skills tested on NCLEX. Understanding how to determine which patient to see first, which intervention to perform first, and how to manage time effectively is essential for safe nursing practice.

## 🎯 Priority-Setting Frameworks

### 1. Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

**Use this when**: Choosing between different types of needs

```
        🔺 HIGHEST PRIORITY
       ╱  ╲
      ╱ 1  ╲  PHYSIOLOGICAL NEEDS
     ╱──────╲  • Airway, Breathing, Circulation
    ╱   2   ╲ • Food, Water, Elimination
   ╱─────────╲ • Temperature regulation
  ╱     3    ╲ SAFETY & SECURITY
 ╱───────────╲ • Physical safety, Freedom from harm
╱      4     ╲ • Infection prevention
──────────────  LOVE & BELONGING
      5        • Social connections, Family
   ──────────   SELF-ESTEEM
      6        • Confidence, Achievement
   ──────────   SELF-ACTUALIZATION
```

**Priority Order**:
1. **Physiological** (Survival needs)
2. **Safety** (Protection from harm)
3. **Love/Belonging** (Psychosocial)
4. **Self-Esteem**
5. **Self-Actualization**

**NCLEX Application**:
- Choose physiological need over psychosocial need
- Choose actual problem over potential problem
- Choose physical safety over emotional comfort

### 2. ABCs - Airway, Breathing, Circulation

**The #1 Priority Framework for NCLEX**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  A - AIRWAY (Always First)                  │
│      • Choking, obstruction                 │
│      • Ensure patent airway                 │
│                                             │
│  B - BREATHING                              │
│      • Respiratory rate/effort              │
│      • Oxygen saturation                    │
│      • Respiratory distress                 │
│                                             │
│  C - CIRCULATION                            │
│      • Pulse, blood pressure                │
│      • Bleeding, shock                      │
│      • Cardiac function                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Remember**: **No airway = Dead in minutes**. Airway ALWAYS comes first.

### 3. Acute vs. Chronic

**Acute Problems** take priority over **Chronic Problems**

| Acute (Priority) | Chronic (Can Wait) |
|------------------|-------------------|
| New onset chest pain | Chronic back pain |
| Sudden confusion | Dementia |
| Acute respiratory distress | COPD baseline dyspnea |
| Active bleeding | Scar from old injury |
| First seizure | Controlled epilepsy |

---

### 4. Actual vs. Potential Problems

**Actual Problems** (happening now) take priority over **Potential/Risk for Problems**

**Examples**:
- Actual infection > Risk for infection
- Actual fall with injury > Risk for falls
- Actual hypoglycemia > Risk for hypoglycemia
- Active bleeding > Risk for bleeding

---

### 5. Stable vs. Unstable

**Unstable patients** take priority over **Stable patients**

**Signs of Instability**:
- Abnormal vital signs (↑↓ HR, BP, RR, Temp)
- Change in level of consciousness
- New symptoms
- Worsening condition
- Acute pain
- Abnormal lab values

**Stable**: Vital signs normal, condition unchanged, chronic issues well-controlled

---

## 🚨 Life-Threatening Situations (ALWAYS First)

### Immediate Life Threats - See/Treat FIRST

```
🚨 EMERGENCY - INTERVENE IMMEDIATELY:

✓ Airway obstruction
✓ Respiratory arrest/severe distress
✓ Cardiac arrest
✓ Active severe bleeding/hemorrhage
✓ Shock
✓ Chest pain (possible MI)
✓ Stroke symptoms
✓ Anaphylaxis
✓ Severe trauma
✓ Seizure (ongoing)
✓ Loss of consciousness
✓ Severe hypoglycemia (<50 mg/dL)
✓ Hyperkalemia with cardiac changes
```

---

## 👥 Multiple Patient Prioritization

### Which Patient to See FIRST?

**Decision Tree**:

```
START: Which patient to see first?
  ↓
STEP 1: Is anyone's AIRWAY/BREATHING/CIRCULATION compromised?
  YES → See that patient FIRST ✓
  NO ↓

STEP 2: Does anyone have LIFE-THREATENING symptoms?
  YES → See that patient FIRST ✓
  NO ↓

STEP 3: Is anyone's condition UNSTABLE or CHANGING?
  YES → See that patient FIRST ✓
  NO ↓

STEP 4: Does anyone have ACUTE problem?
  YES → See that patient before chronic issues ✓
  NO ↓

STEP 5: Choose based on TIME-SENSITIVE needs
  (scheduled procedures, pre-op, post-op) ✓
```

### NCLEX Priority Questions - Common Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Four Patients - Who First?

**A)** Post-op day 2, stable vital signs, requesting pain medication
**B)** New admission with chest pain and diaphoresis
**C)** Patient with diabetes, blood glucose 250 mg/dL
**D)** Patient with chronic kidney disease for routine dialysis

**Answer: B** - Chest pain and diaphoresis = possible MI (life-threatening)

**Rationale**:
- B: ABCs - Circulation at risk, acute, unstable
- A: Stable, chronic pain can wait few minutes
- C: Elevated but not critical glucose
- D: Routine, scheduled, stable

---

#### Scenario 2: Which Patient to Assess First?

**A)** Patient with COPD, O2 sat 88% on 2L O2 (baseline)
**B)** Post-op patient, O2 sat suddenly dropped from 98% to 89%
**C)** Patient with anxiety requesting to talk
**D)** Patient requesting assistance to bathroom

**Answer: B** - Sudden change (acute problem, unstable)

**Rationale**:
- B: BREATHING - Acute change, unstable
- A: Chronic condition, baseline for COPD
- C: Psychosocial need (lower priority)
- D: Can delegate to UAP

---

## ⚡ Time-Sensitive vs. Can Wait

### TIME-SENSITIVE (Higher Priority)

- Pre-op medications (must give on time)
- Insulin/diabetes medications (scheduled)
- Cardiac medications (specific timing)
- Antibiotics (first dose STAT)
- Time-sensitive labs (fasting, peak/trough)
- Scheduled procedures/surgery prep
- Post-op assessments (frequent monitoring)

### CAN WAIT (Lower Priority)

- Routine vital signs
- Patient teaching (when stable)
- Discharge planning
- Documentation
- Routine medications with wide time window
- Assistance with ADLs (can delegate)

---

## 🔄 Delegation & Assignment

### Priority Principle: **Unstable = RN; Stable = Can Delegate**

**RN ONLY** (Cannot Delegate):
- Unstable patients
- Complex assessments
- IV medications
- Patient/family teaching
- Developing care plans
- Sterile procedures

**Can Delegate to LPN/LVN**:
- Stable patients
- Medications (PO, IM, SubQ - per state practice act)
- Sterile dressing changes
- Suctioning
- Tube feedings
- Data collection

**Can Delegate to UAP/CNA**:
- Stable patients
- Routine vital signs
- ADLs (bathing, feeding, toileting)
- Ambulation
- Non-sterile tasks
- Intake/output documentation

### Who to Assign to New Graduate RN?

- **Stable** patients with **predictable** outcomes
- **Routine** care
- **NOT**: Unstable, complex, critical care patients

## 🎯 Nursing Process as Priority Tool

### Remember: **Assessment Before Implementation**

```
PRIORITY ORDER:
  1. ASSESSMENT ← Do this first
  2. ANALYSIS/DIAGNOSIS
  3. PLANNING
  4. IMPLEMENTATION ← Do this after assessment
  5. EVALUATION
```

**Exception**: Life-threatening emergency → Act immediately (e.g., choking → Heimlich, don't assess first)

**NCLEX Tip**: If question asks "What should nurse do FIRST?" and one option is assessment → usually correct!

---

## 🏥 Common NCLEX Priority Situations

### Post-Operative Priorities

**Immediate Post-Op (PACU)**:
1. **Airway** patency
2. **Breathing** - respiratory rate, depth, O2 sat
3. **Circulation** - vital signs, bleeding
4. **Neurological** - level of consciousness
5. **Pain**
6. **Surgical site** - dressing, drains

**Priority Assessment**: Airway and vital signs FIRST

---

### Obstetric Priorities

**Mother vs. Baby**:
- **If question asks "What is the priority?"** → Usually mother
- **Mother's ABCs stabilize baby** (baby depends on mother)

**Exceptions**:
- Prolapsed cord → Baby at risk
- Shoulder dystocia → Baby at risk

**Labor Priorities**:
1. FHR (fetal heart rate) abnormalities
2. Bleeding/hemorrhage
3. Signs of eclampsia (seizures, severe headache, visual changes)
4. Cord prolapse
5. Ruptured uterus

---

### Cardiac Priorities

**Chest Pain**:
1. **Assess** ABCs
2. **Call** for help/activate rapid response
3. **Position** - High Fowler's or position of comfort
4. **Oxygen** if O2 sat <94%
5. **Medications** - Nitroglycerin (if ordered)
6. **Monitor** cardiac rhythm, vital signs
7. **IV** access
8. **Labs** - Troponin, ECG

**Remember**: **MONA** (old protocol, still helpful):
- **M**orphine
- **O**xygen
- **N**itroglycerin
- **A**spirin

---

### Trauma Priorities

**Primary Survey** (Life threats):
- **A**irway (with C-spine protection)
- **B**reathing
- **C**irculation (stop bleeding)
- **D**isability (neurological)
- **E**xposure (remove clothing, assess injuries)

**Secondary Survey** (After life threats addressed):
- Head-to-toe assessment
- History
- Diagnostics

---

## 🧠 Critical Thinking for Priorities

### Ask Yourself:

```
PRIORITY DECISION-MAKING QUESTIONS:

1. "Is this life-threatening?"
   YES → Priority

2. "Is the ABCs at risk?"
   YES → Priority

3. "Is this an ACTUAL problem or POTENTIAL problem?"
   Actual → Priority

4. "Is this ACUTE or CHRONIC?"
   Acute → Priority

5. "Is the patient STABLE or UNSTABLE?"
   Unstable → Priority

6. "Can this wait 5 minutes?"
   NO → Priority
   YES → Can wait

7. "Can I delegate this?"
   YES → Lower priority for you
   NO → You must do it
```

## 🔑 Key NCLEX Priority Rules

### The "Always/Never" of Priorities

**ALWAYS Higher Priority**:
- ✓ Airway over anything else
- ✓ Acute over chronic
- ✓ Actual over potential
- ✓ Unstable over stable
- ✓ Life-threatening over non-life-threatening
- ✓ Assessment before intervention (except emergency)
- ✓ Physical needs over psychosocial needs
- ✓ ABC order: Airway → Breathing → Circulation

**NEVER Do First** (unless no other option):
- ✗ Documentation
- ✗ Teaching (when acute issues present)
- ✗ Psychosocial interventions (when physical needs present)
- ✗ Routine care (when emergencies present)

---

## 💡 NCLEX Success Strategies

### Mnemonic: **PRIORITY**

- **P**hysical needs before psychosocial
- **R**espiratory/Airway first (ABCs)
- **I**nstability = See first
- **O**bserve ABCs in every question
- **R**eal (actual) before risk (potential)
- **I**mmediate threats = First
- **T**ime-sensitive actions
- **Y**ou assess before implementing (except emergency)

---

### Test-Taking Tips

1. **Eliminate stable patients** when looking for priority
2. **Look for ABCs** - airway/breathing/circulation problems
3. **Acute beats chronic** almost always
4. **Assessment before implementation** (unless life-threatening emergency)
5. **Time-sensitive** beats routine
6. **Can it be delegated?** Then it's lower priority for RN

## 📝 Practice Questions

<details>
<summary>Question 1: Nurse receives report on 4 patients. Which should be seen FIRST?</summary>

**Patients**:
A) DM Type 2, blood glucose 180 mg/dL, wants breakfast
B) Post-op appendectomy, requesting pain medication
C) Asthma, RR 32, using accessory muscles
D) CVA, needs assistance to bathroom

**Answer: C** - Respiratory distress

**Rationale**: **BREATHING** (ABCs). RR 32 + accessory muscles = respiratory distress, acute, unstable. Life-threatening priority. Others are stable or can wait.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 2: What is the nurse's FIRST action when patient is choking?</summary>

**Answer**: Perform abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver)

**Rationale**: **AIRWAY** obstruction = life-threatening emergency. ACT immediately - don't assess first. Airway always first priority.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 3: Which patient can be assigned to new graduate nurse?</summary>

**Patients**:
A) Newly admitted with acute MI
B) Post-op day 3, stable, preparing for discharge
C) Septic shock, requiring vasopressors
D) Acute exacerbation of COPD, O2 sat 84%

**Answer: B** - Stable, routine care

**Rationale**: New grads should receive stable patients with predictable outcomes. A, C, D are all unstable, complex, or critical - need experienced RN.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 4: Nurse is caring for patient receiving blood transfusion. Patient reports chills and back pain. What is the FIRST action?</summary>

**Answer**: Stop the transfusion immediately

**Rationale**: Chills + back pain = transfusion reaction (potential life-threatening). STOP transfusion FIRST (intervention), then assess vital signs, maintain IV access, notify provider.
</details>
