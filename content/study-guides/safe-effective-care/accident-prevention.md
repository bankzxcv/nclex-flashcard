## 🛡️ Culture of Safety

### Key Principles

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  CULTURE OF SAFETY FOUNDATIONS:                   │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  • Safety is everyone's responsibility            │
│  • Focus on systems, not individuals              │
│  • Encourage reporting without punishment         │
│  • Learn from errors and near-misses              │
│  • Continuously improve processes                 │
│  • Speak up when you see safety concerns          │
│  • "See something, say something"                 │

## 🚨 Fall Prevention

### Fall Risk Factors

**Intrinsic (Patient) Factors**:
```
HIGH RISK FOR FALLS:
✓ Age >65 years
✓ History of falls
✓ Impaired mobility/gait instability
✓ Weakness, decreased muscle strength
✓ Impaired cognition/confusion/dementia
✓ Urinary frequency/urgency/incontinence
✓ Vision impairment
✓ Orthostatic hypotension
✓ Medications (sedatives, diuretics, antihypertensives)
✓ Acute illness
✓ Pain
✓ Depression
```

**Extrinsic (Environmental) Factors**:
- Wet floors
- Poor lighting
- Clutter, obstacles
- Lack of handrails
- Improper footwear
- Bed/chair at wrong height
- Lack of assistive devices

---

### Fall Risk Assessment Tools

**Common Tools**:
- **Morse Fall Scale** (most common in hospitals)
- **Hendrich II Fall Risk Model**
- **STRATIFY**
- **Schmid Fall Risk Assessment Tool** (FRAT)

**When to Assess**:
- On admission
- With change in condition
- After a fall
- With medication changes
- Per facility policy (often every shift)

---

### Fall Prevention Interventions

```
UNIVERSAL FALL PRECAUTIONS (ALL PATIENTS):

BED SAFETY:
  ✓ Bed in lowest position
  ✓ Wheels locked
  ✓ Side rails up (per policy - not all 4)

ENVIRONMENT:
  ✓ Call light within reach
  ✓ Personal items within reach
  ✓ Clear pathways, remove clutter
  ✓ Adequate lighting
  ✓ Non-skid footwear/socks
  ✓ Clean up spills immediately

TOILETING:
  ✓ Scheduled toileting (q2h)
  ✓ Bedside commode if needed
  ✓ Assist to bathroom

MONITORING:
  ✓ Frequent rounding (hourly rounding)
  ✓ Observe for confusion, agitation
  ✓ Check for orthostatic hypotension

EDUCATION:
  ✓ Teach patient to call for help
  ✓ Explain fall risks
  ✓ Family education
```

---

### High-Risk Fall Interventions

**For patients at HIGH RISK**:
- ✓ **Yellow** fall risk band/sign
- ✓ Bed/chair alarms
- ✓ Room close to nurse's station
- ✓ Hourly rounding (or more frequent)
- ✓ Mobility aids (walker, cane)
- ✓ Physical therapy consult
- ✓ Review medications (reduce sedatives)
- ✓ Consider bed mat/low bed

**Controversial/AVOID**:
- ✗ Restraints (increase fall risk and injury)
- ✗ All 4 side rails up (considered restraint)

---

### Side Rails: Safety vs. Restraint

| 2-3 Side Rails | All 4 Side Rails Up |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Safety device | Considered restraint |
| Helps with position changes | Patient may climb over → higher fall risk |
| Legal | Requires restraint order |
| Promotes independence | Restricts freedom |

**NCLEX Key**: All 4 side rails = Restraint

---

### Post-Fall Protocol

**Immediate Actions**:
1. **Stay with patient**, call for help
2. **Assess** for injury (don't move if injury suspected)
3. **Vital signs**, neurological assessment
4. **Notify** physician
5. **Complete** incident report
6. **Reassess** fall risk
7. **Implement** additional interventions

**Documentation**:
- Document in medical record factually
- "Patient found on floor" (not "patient fell")
- Describe patient condition, interventions
- Complete separate incident/occurrence report

---

## 💊 Medication Error Prevention

### High-Alert Medications

**Medications with Highest Risk of Harm**:
```
HIGH-ALERT MEDICATIONS:
  • Insulin
  • Heparin, Warfarin
  • Opioids (morphine, fentanyl)
  • Sedatives
  • Chemotherapy
  • Potassium chloride IV
  • Neuromuscular blocking agents
  • Contrast media

REMEMBER: "I Have One Serious Concern - Patients Need Care"
(Insulin, Heparin, Opioids, Sedatives, Chemo, Potassium,
 Neuromuscular blockers, Contrast)
```

---

### Six Rights of Medication Administration

```
THE 6 RIGHTS (Minimum):

  ✓ Use two-nurse verification for high-risk meds
  ✓ Barcode scanning

CALCULATIONS:
  ✓ Double-check all calculations
  ✓ Have another nurse verify high-risk doses
  ✓ Use calculator
  ✓ Know usual dose ranges

LOOK-ALIKE/SOUND-ALIKE:
  ✓ Be aware (e.g., hydrOXYzine vs hydrALAzine)
  ✓ Use tall-man lettering
  ✓ Read labels carefully
  ✓ Don't rely on memory

IF UNSURE:
  ✓ Look it up - never guess
  ✓ Ask pharmacist
  ✓ Verify with prescriber
  ✓ Use drug reference
```

### When Medication Error Occurs

**Immediate Actions**:
1. **Assess patient** - vital signs, symptoms
2. **Notify physician** immediately
3. **Follow physician orders** for interventions
4. **Document** factually in medical record
5. **Complete** incident/error report
6. **Monitor** patient closely
7. **Be honest** with patient/family

**Documentation**:
- Medical record: Factual, objective
- "Patient received [medication] [dose] at [time]"
- Describe patient response, interventions
- Do NOT write "error" or "incident report filed" in medical record

**Incident Report**:
- Separate confidential document

## 📝 Practice Questions

<details>
<summary>Question 1: Patient trying to get out of bed, pulling at IV. What should nurse do FIRST?</summary>

**Answer**: Stay with patient and ask what they need

**Rationale**: Try alternatives first before considering restraints. Patient may need toileting, pain relief, reorientation. Assess needs first. Restraints are last resort.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 2: Nurse gives patient wrong medication. What is the FIRST action?</summary>

**Answer**: Assess patient's vital signs and condition

**Rationale**: Patient safety first. Assess for adverse effects. Then notify physician, follow orders, monitor patient. Document factually. Complete incident report separately.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 3: Which is a restraint?</summary>

**Answer**: Raising all four side rails on patient's bed

**Rationale**: All 4 side rails up is considered restraint - restricts freedom of movement and patient may climb over (increased fall risk). Use only 2-3 side rails.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 4: Fire alarm sounds. What is nurse's FIRST action?</summary>

**Answer**: Rescue patients in immediate danger

**Rationale**: RACE - Rescue first! Move patients away from fire/smoke. Then Alarm (if not already activated), Contain (close doors), Extinguish or Evacuate.
