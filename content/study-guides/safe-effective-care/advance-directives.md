# Advance Directives & Self-Determination

## Overview

Advance directives are legal documents that allow clients to make healthcare decisions in advance, ensuring their wishes are respected when they cannot speak for themselves. Understanding advance directives is crucial for the NCLEX and ethical nursing practice.

---

## 🏛️ Legal Foundation

### Patient Self-Determination Act (PSDA) - 1990

**Key Requirements:**
- All healthcare facilities receiving Medicare/Medicaid must:
  - Provide written information about advance directives
  - Ask if patient has an advance directive
  - Document the directive in the medical record
  - Educate staff and community about advance directives
  - Not discriminate based on presence/absence of directive

---

## 📋 Types of Advance Directives

### 1. Living Will

**Definition**: Written document specifying desired medical treatment if terminally ill or permanently unconscious

**What it covers:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  LIVING WILL TYPICALLY ADDRESSES:               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  ✓ Use of life-sustaining treatment             │
│  ✓ Mechanical ventilation preferences            │
│  ✓ Artificial nutrition and hydration           │
│  ✓ CPR (Do Not Resuscitate - DNR)               │
│  ✓ Dialysis                                      │
│  ✓ Organ donation wishes                        │
│  ✓ Pain management preferences                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Points:**
- Only activated when patient cannot make decisions
- Must be signed and witnessed (requirements vary by state)
- Can be revoked at any time while competent
- Takes effect only in terminal or permanently unconscious states

### 2. Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare (DPOA-HC)

**Also called**: Healthcare Proxy, Healthcare Agent, Healthcare Surrogate

**Definition**: Legal document naming someone to make healthcare decisions if patient is incapacitated

**Comparison with Living Will:**

| Feature | Living Will | Durable POA for Healthcare |
|---------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **What it is** | Document stating wishes | Names decision-maker |
| **Scope** | Specific treatments only | All healthcare decisions |
| **Flexibility** | Limited to written wishes | Agent can adapt to situations |
| **When active** | Terminal/unconscious only | Any time patient incapacitated |
| **Best for** | Clear end-of-life wishes | Trusted person to decide |

**Healthcare Agent Responsibilities:**
- Make decisions consistent with patient's values
- Communicate with healthcare team
- Access medical records
- Authorize or refuse treatment
- Choose healthcare providers

---

### 3. Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) Order

**Definition**: Medical order stating CPR should NOT be performed if heart/breathing stops

**Types of DNR:**

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  DNR IN-HOSPITAL                                      │
│  • Written physician order in chart                   │
│  • Must be renewed per facility policy                │
│  • Staff must honor immediately                       │
│                                                       │
│  DNR OUT-OF-HOSPITAL / EMS DNR                        │
│  • Portable document for home/long-term care          │
│  • EMS personnel must see document                    │
│  • Some states use special forms/bracelets            │
│                                                       │
│  DNR COMFORT CARE / DNR COMFORT CARE ARREST           │
│  • No CPR but other treatments continue               │
│  • Focus on comfort measures                          │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Important Distinctions:**
- DNR ≠ "Do Not Treat"
- DNR only applies to CPR
- Other treatments continue unless specified
- Patient can still receive medications, oxygen, etc.

### 4. Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST/MOLST)

**Also called**: MOLST (Medical Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment), POST

**Definition**: Medical order form for seriously ill patients documenting specific treatment wishes

**POLST vs Advance Directive:**

| POLST | Advance Directive |
|-------|------------------|
| Medical order (signed by physician) | Legal document (signed by patient) |
| Specific medical orders | General wishes |
| For seriously ill/frail patients | For any adult |
| Immediately actionable | Requires interpretation |
| Bright colored form (often pink) | Standard legal document |

**Common POLST Sections:**
1. **Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation** (CPR vs DNR)
2. **Medical Interventions** (Full treatment vs Selective vs Comfort-focused)
3. **Artificially Administered Nutrition** (Long-term feeding tube)
4. **Signature** (Patient or healthcare agent AND physician)

---

## 👨‍⚕️ Nursing Responsibilities

### At Admission

```
✓ ASK: "Do you have an advance directive?"
✓ DOCUMENT: Response in medical record
✓ OBTAIN: Copy of advance directive if available
✓ SCAN/FILE: In patient's chart
✓ COMMUNICATE: With interdisciplinary team
✓ FLAG: Chart to indicate presence of AD
```

### Patient Education

**What to Teach:**
- Purpose and importance of advance directives
- Difference between living will and healthcare POA
- How to complete the forms
- Importance of discussing wishes with family
- Can be changed anytime while competent
- Provide written information and resources

**When to Educate:**
- At hospital admission
- During wellness visits
- Before major surgery
- Upon diagnosis of serious illness
- NOT during acute crisis or emergency

---

### If Patient Doesn't Have Advance Directive

**NEVER:**
- ✗ Pressure patient to create one
- ✗ Imply they "should" have one
- ✗ Make them feel guilty
- ✗ Require it for treatment

**DO:**
- ✓ Provide information about advance directives
- ✓ Offer resources (social work, chaplain, legal aid)
- ✓ Explain benefits of documenting wishes
- ✓ Respect their choice not to have one

---

## ⚖️ Ethical Principles

### Autonomy
- **Right to self-determination**
- Patients control their own healthcare decisions
- Advance directives extend autonomy beyond capacity

### Beneficence
- **Act in patient's best interest**
- Honor patient's definition of "best interest"
- Follow documented wishes

### Non-maleficence
- **"Do no harm"**
- Unwanted treatment can be harmful
- Respect DNR to avoid unwanted resuscitation

### Fidelity
- **Faithfulness to patient**
- Advocate for patient wishes
- Ensure advance directive is followed

---

## 🚨 Special Situations

### Patient Changes Mind

**Scenario**: Patient has DNR but during code says "Help me!"

**Action**:
- ✓ Verbal request overrides written directive
- ✓ Begin resuscitation immediately
- ✓ Document the situation
- ✓ Discuss with patient when stable
- ✓ Update orders as appropriate

**Remember**: Competent patient's current wishes ALWAYS supersede written directive

---

### Family Disagrees with Advance Directive

**Scenario**: Patient has DNR, but family demands "do everything"

**Action**:
- ✓ Respect patient's documented wishes
- ✓ Explain advance directive to family
- ✓ Provide emotional support
- ✓ Offer chaplain, ethics committee
- ✓ Document discussions
- ✗ Do NOT violate patient's wishes

**Remember**: Advance directive reflects PATIENT wishes, not family preferences

---

### Healthcare Agent Unavailable During Emergency

**Order of Decision-Makers** (if no healthcare proxy):
1. Court-appointed guardian
2. Spouse/domestic partner
3. Adult children (majority agreement)
4. Parents
5. Adult siblings (majority agreement)
6. Other relatives

**Note**: State laws vary - know your state's hierarchy

---

### Pregnancy and Advance Directives

- Many states suspend advance directives during pregnancy
- Check state-specific laws
- Some states allow pregnant women to specify wishes
- Ethical and legal complexities increase

---

## 📊 Decision-Making Capacity vs Competence

### Capacity
- **Clinical determination**
- Made by healthcare provider
- Can fluctuate (e.g., delirium)
- Specific to particular decision
- **Example**: Patient may have capacity to choose lunch but not capacity to refuse surgery

### Competence
- **Legal determination**
- Declared by court
- Generally permanent until reversed by court
- Global status
- **Example**: Court declares patient incompetent, guardian appointed

**Components of Decision-Making Capacity:**

```
PATIENT MUST BE ABLE TO:
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. UNDERSTAND information about treatment      │
│ 2. APPRECIATE how it applies to their situation │
│ 3. REASON about risks/benefits                  │
│ 4. COMMUNICATE a choice                         │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🔑 Key NCLEX Concepts

### Mnemonic: **DIRECTIVE**

- **D**ocument all advance directives in chart
- **I**nform patient of rights at admission
- **R**espect patient autonomy and wishes
- **E**ducate about advance directive options
- **C**ompetent patient can revoke anytime
- **T**alk to family about patient's wishes
- **I**nterdisciplinary team must be aware
- **V**erbal request overrides written directive
- **E**thics committee available for conflicts

---

## 📝 Common NCLEX Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Admission Assessment

**Question**: Nurse admits 68-year-old for hip replacement. What should nurse ask about advance directives?

**Answer**: "Do you have an advance directive such as a living will or healthcare power of attorney?"

**Rationale**: Patient Self-Determination Act requires asking about advance directives at admission. Use open-ended, neutral language.

---

### Scenario 2: DNR Confusion

**Question**: Family asks, "Does DNR mean we're giving up on dad?"

**Best Response**:
- ✓ "DNR means if his heart stops, we won't do CPR. All other treatments continue."
- ✓ "We'll still provide all medications, oxygen, and treatments to help him."
- ✗ Avoid: "Yes, DNR means we stop treatment" (INCORRECT)

---

### Scenario 3: Conflicting Wishes

**Question**: Patient's living will states "no feeding tube" but daughter says "Mom would want nutrition."

**Action**:
- Follow living will (patient's documented wishes)
- Explain to daughter this reflects mother's autonomous decision
- Offer support, chaplain, ethics consultation
- Do NOT place feeding tube

---

## 💡 Clinical Practice Tips

### Documentation

**Always document:**
- Presence or absence of advance directive
- Copy obtained and placed in chart
- Patient's understanding of advance directive
- Discussions with family/healthcare agent
- Any conflicts or concerns
- Ethics committee consultations

### Communication

**Effective phrases:**
- "Have you thought about who you'd want to make medical decisions if you couldn't?"
- "What's most important to you if you became seriously ill?"
- "Have you talked with your family about your wishes?"
- "I can provide information about advance directives if you're interested"

**Avoid:**
- "You need to have an advance directive"
- "Don't you want to protect your family from hard decisions?"
- Discussing during acute crisis

---

## 📚 State-Specific Variations

**Important to Know:**
- Advance directive laws vary by state
- Forms may differ between states
- Witness requirements differ
- Some states recognize oral directives
- Reciprocity between states varies

**Best Practice:**
- Check your state's specific requirements
- Use state-approved forms when available
- Update directive when moving states
- Keep copies in multiple locations

## ✅ Quick Reference Summary

| Document | Who Signs | Who Decides | When Active |
|----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Living Will** | Patient | Automated based on document | Terminal/permanently unconscious |
| **Healthcare POA** | Patient names agent | Healthcare agent | When patient lacks capacity |
| **DNR Order** | Physician (with patient consent) | Patient choice | During cardiac/respiratory arrest |
| **POLST** | Patient + Physician | Based on documented orders | Immediately for seriously ill |

## 🎯 NCLEX Success Tips

**High-Yield Facts:**
1. Patient Self-Determination Act requires asking about advance directives
2. Competent patient can ALWAYS revoke advance directive
3. Current verbal wishes override written directive
4. DNR only addresses CPR - all other treatments continue
5. Healthcare proxy makes decisions when patient can't
6. Living will is specific to terminal/permanent unconscious state
7. Family doesn't override patient's documented wishes
8. Nurse's role is to educate, document, and advocate - not pressure

**Common Test Distractors:**
- "Force patient to make advance directive" - WRONG (violates autonomy)
- "Follow family wishes over patient's living will" - WRONG (patient wishes priority)
- "DNR means stop all treatment" - WRONG (only applies to CPR)
- "Require advance directive for surgery" - WRONG (cannot require)

## 📖 Practice Questions

<details>
<summary>Question 1: A patient with a DNR order experiences respiratory distress. What should the nurse do?</summary>

**Answer**: Provide oxygen, elevate head of bed, assess respiratory status, notify physician.

**Rationale**: DNR only applies to CPR (cardiac/respiratory arrest). This patient is in distress but NOT arrested. Provide all appropriate interventions for respiratory distress. DNR does NOT mean "do not treat."
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 2: Patient says "I want to tear up my living will." What should the nurse do first?</summary>

**Answer**: Allow patient to destroy document and document the action.

**Rationale**: Competent patient has absolute right to revoke advance directive at any time. Support patient's autonomy. Document revocation in medical record and notify physician and team.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 3: Which statement by nurse shows understanding of healthcare power of attorney?</summary>

**Answer**: "The healthcare agent makes decisions only when the patient cannot make their own decisions."

**Rationale**: Healthcare POA/proxy is activated when patient lacks decision-making capacity. While patient is competent, they make their own decisions.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 4: At admission, patient says "I don't have an advance directive." What should nurse do?</summary>

**Answer**: Document response and offer information about advance directives.

**Rationale**: Document the response per PSDA requirements. Offer information but never pressure. Patient has right to decline advance directive.
</details>
