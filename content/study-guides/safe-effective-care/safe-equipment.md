- ✓ Wheels **locked** at all times (unless moving)
- ✓ Side rails per policy (usually 2-3, NOT all 4)

**When to Raise Bed**:
- During nursing care (proper ergonomics)
- **Always lower back down when finished**

**Trendelenburg** (head down):
- Shock management
- Postural drainage
- NEVER for CPR (use flat/supine)

**Reverse Trendelenburg** (feet down):
- GERD, aspiration prevention
- Improve breathing
- Reduce peripheral edema

| **OCCLUSION** | Blockage in line | Check for kinked tubing, check IV site, assess for infiltration |
| **DOWNSTREAM** | Problem after pump | Check IV site, assess catheter patency |
| **UPSTREAM** | Problem before pump | Check IV bag/bottle, ensure not empty, check tubing |
| **LOW BATTERY** | Battery running low | Plug into outlet immediately |
| **DOOR OPEN** | Pump door not closed | Close pump door securely |

**NEVER**: Ignore or silence alarms repeatedly - investigate cause!

### PCA (Patient-Controlled Analgesia) Pumps

**Special Safety Considerations**:
```
PCA SAFETY:

✓ Two-nurse verification of setup
✓ Patient education (how to use button)
✓ Basal rate + demand dose + lockout interval set correctly
✓ ONLY patient pushes button (not family/staff)
✓ Assess respiratory rate before each dose
✓ Pulse oximetry monitoring for high-risk patients
✓ Naloxone (Narcan) readily available
✓ Frequent monitoring (sedation scale, respiratory rate)

DANGER SIGNS:
  • Respiratory rate <12/min
  • Oxygen saturation <92%
  • Increased sedation
  • Confusion
  → Notify physician immediately
```

**Never**: Allow family members to push PCA button (risk of oversedation)

```

---

### Oxygen Delivery Devices

| Device | Flow Rate | FiO2 | When to Use |
|--------|-----------|------|-------------|
| **Nasal Cannula** | 1-6 L/min | 24-44% | Stable patient, mild hypoxia |
| **Simple Face Mask** | 5-10 L/min | 40-60% | Short-term, moderate hypoxia |
| **Non-Rebreather** | 10-15 L/min | 60-95% | Emergency, severe hypoxia |
| **Venturi Mask** | Varies | 24-50% (precise) | COPD (precise O2 control) |
| **Face Tent** | 10-15 L/min | 30-55% | Facial trauma, claustrophobia |

**Key Points**:
- Nasal cannula: Most common, comfortable
- Non-rebreather: Highest O2 concentration, bag must inflate
- Venturi: Most precise FiO2, best for COPD
- Never <5 L/min on face mask (CO2 rebreathing)

## 🌡️ Temperature Measurement Devices

### Thermometer Safety

| Route | Contraindications | Safety Considerations |
|-------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Oral** | Unconscious, seizures, mouth surgery, infants | Wait 15 min after hot/cold drinks |
| **Rectal** | Rectal surgery, cardiac patients, neutropenic | Use lubricant, insert gently |
| **Axillary** | None (safest) | Least accurate, for screening |
| **Tympanic** | Ear infection, ear surgery | Pull ear correctly (up/back adult) |
| **Temporal** | None | Avoid sweaty forehead |

**Never**:
- ✗ Use oral thermometer rectally
- ✗ Use rectal thermometer orally

## 🩺 Blood Pressure Equipment

### Manual BP Cuff

**Proper Technique**:
```
CORRECT CUFF SIZE:
  ✓ Bladder width = 40% of arm circumference
  ✓ Bladder length covers 80% of arm circumference
  ✓ Too small cuff = falsely HIGH reading
  ✓ Too large cuff = falsely LOW reading

POSITIONING:
  ✓ Arm at heart level
  ✓ Patient sitting, feet flat, back supported
  ✓ Arm bare (no clothing)
  ✓ Patient relaxed 5 minutes before

TECHNIQUE:
  ✓ Palpate brachial artery
  ✓ Center bladder over artery
  ✓ Inflate 20-30 mmHg above palpated systolic
  ✓ Deflate 2-3 mmHg per second
  ✓ Note first sound (systolic) and last sound (diastolic)
```

### Automatic BP Devices

**Safety**:
- ✓ Verify correct cuff size
- ✓ Set appropriate interval (not too frequent)
- ✓ Assess arm for circulation/skin integrity
- ✓ Manually verify if reading seems abnormal
- ✓ Rotate arms if frequent monitoring

**When NOT to use**:
- Arm with IV, dialysis access, mastectomy, injury
- Rapid irregular heart rates (may be inaccurate)

  ✓ All 4 legs on ground before weight-bearing
  ✓ Rubber tips intact
  ✓ Assess patient ability to use properly

TWO-WHEELED WALKER:
  ✓ Push forward, don't lift
  ✓ Easier for patients with weakness
  ✓ Less stable than standard walker
```

**Cane Safety**:
- ✓ Hold cane on **strong side**
- ✓ Advance cane and weak leg together
- ✓ Wide base quad cane = more stable
- ✓ Tip intact and non-slip

**Crutch Safety**:
- ✓ 2-3 finger widths between axilla and crutch top

## 📝 Practice Questions

<details>
<summary>Question 1: IV pump alarming "AIR IN LINE." What should nurse do first?</summary>

**Answer**: Stop the pump and check tubing for air

**Rationale**: Stop infusion immediately when air alarm sounds. Inspect tubing for air bubbles. Remove air by tapping tubing or aspirating. Never ignore IV pump alarms.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 2: Which blood pressure cuff should be used for an obese patient?</summary>

**Answer**: Large adult cuff (thigh cuff)

**Rationale**: Cuff bladder width should be 40% of arm circumference. Too small cuff gives falsely HIGH readings. Use appropriately sized cuff for accurate reading.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 3: Patient with COPD receiving oxygen via nasal cannula at 2 L/min. Patient requests oxygen be increased. What should nurse do?</summary>

**Answer**: Explain that oxygen requires physician order and assess patient's oxygen saturation

**Rationale**: Oxygen is a medication requiring physician order. Assess patient first (SpO2, respiratory status). High-flow oxygen can suppress respiratory drive in COPD patients. Notify physician of patient request.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 4: Before providing care at bedside, what should the nurse check regarding the bed?</summary>

**Answer**: Ensure bed wheels are locked

**Rationale**: Locked wheels prevent bed from moving during care, preventing falls/injuries. Check every time before providing care. Unlock only when intentionally moving bed.
