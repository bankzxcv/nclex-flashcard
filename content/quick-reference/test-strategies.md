# NCLEX Test-Taking Strategies

## Core Test-Taking Principles

### ABC Priority Framework
**Always prioritize in this order:**
1. **Airway** - Is the airway patent and protected?
2. **Breathing** - Is the patient breathing adequately?
3. **Circulation** - Does the patient have adequate circulation?

**Examples:**
- Patient with chest pain AND difficulty breathing → Breathing first
- Unconscious patient → Airway first
- Bleeding patient → Circulation first

### Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs
**Priority order from bottom to top:**
1. **Physiological** - Oxygen, food, water, elimination, rest
2. **Safety & Security** - Physical safety, fall prevention, infection control
3. **Love & Belonging** - Family, social support
4. **Self-Esteem** - Body image, confidence
5. **Self-Actualization** - Growth, learning

**Use when:** No life-threatening emergency exists

### Nursing Process Priority
**Assessment → Analysis → Planning → Implementation → Evaluation**
- **Assess first** unless the question states assessment is already complete
- **Intervene immediately** if life-threatening situation
- **Don't assess** if patient is in crisis (ABC first)

## Question Analysis Strategies

### Key Word Recognition

| Key Word | What It Means | Strategy |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| **Priority, First, Initial, Best, Most** | One answer is better than others | Use ABC, Maslow, Safety |
| **Early, Late** | Timing matters | Know disease progression |
| **Immediately, Urgent** | Life-threatening situation | Think ABC, safety |
| **Teaching, Learning** | Patient education | Look for understanding or need for more teaching |
| **Discharge, Home** | Safe for home care | Consider safety, independence |
| **Delegation** | Who can do this task? | RN vs LPN vs UAP scope |

### Question Stems to Watch

| Stem Type | What to Do |
|-----------|------------|
| **"Which statement INDICATES understanding?"** | Look for CORRECT information |
| **"Which statement requires FURTHER teaching?"** | Look for INCORRECT information |
| **"What should the nurse do FIRST?"** | Use ABC, Nursing Process |
| **"What is the PRIORITY?"** | Use ABC, Maslow, Safety |
| **"What is CONTRAINDICATED?"** | What should NOT be done |
| **"Which finding is EXPECTED/NORMAL?"** | Know normal vs abnormal |
| **"Which finding requires INTERVENTION?"** | Look for abnormal/concerning data |

## Answer Elimination Strategies

### 1. Eliminate Similar Options
- If 2-3 answers say essentially the same thing, eliminate all of them
- The correct answer will be different

### 2. Eliminate Absolute Words
**Usually WRONG:** Always, never, all, none, every, only, must
**Usually CORRECT:** May, could, usually, generally, often, frequently

**Exception:** Safety issues (always check ID, never leave patient alone during seizure)

### 3. Eliminate Options That:
- Pass the buck (call the doctor when you can handle it)
- Ignore the patient's feelings/concerns
- Are judgmental or punitive
- Block communication
- Are false or unrealistic reassurance ("Don't worry, everything will be fine")
- Give patient control over medical decisions

### 4. Choose Options That:
- Empower the patient
- Show therapeutic communication
- Prioritize safety
- Follow ABC/Maslow
- Are within nursing scope
- Address the patient's concern

## Therapeutic Communication

### Choose These Responses:
- **Open-ended questions**: "Tell me more about..."
- **Reflection**: "You seem upset about..."
- **Clarification**: "Help me understand what you mean..."
- **Focusing**: "Let's talk more about..."
- **Silence**: Allowing time to think
- **Acknowledging feelings**: "That must be difficult..."

### AVOID These Responses:
- **Closed questions**: "Are you sad?" (Yes/No)
- **Why questions**: "Why did you do that?" (Defensive)
- **False reassurance**: "Everything will be fine"
- **Giving advice**: "You should..."
- **Changing subject**: Patient says "I'm scared" → "Let's talk about your diet"
- **Agreeing/Disagreeing**: Takes away autonomy
- **Defending**: "The doctor is very good"

## Safety & Infection Control

### Patient Safety Priority
1. **Fall prevention** - High priority; use ABC if injury occurs
2. **Suicide risk** - Remove harmful objects, constant observation
3. **Seizure** - Side-lying position, protect head, don't restrain
4. **Bleeding/Hemorrhage** - Apply pressure, elevate if possible
5. **Airway obstruction** - Heimlich, suction, position

### Infection Control Hierarchy
1. **Standard Precautions** - Use with ALL patients (hand hygiene, PPE)
2. **Transmission-Based Precautions**:
   - **Airborne** (N95): TB, measles, varicella (chickenpox)
   - **Droplet** (surgical mask): Influenza, pertussis, meningitis
   - **Contact** (gown & gloves): MRSA, VRE, C. diff

### Hand Hygiene
- **Most important** infection control measure
- Before and after patient contact
- After removing gloves
- Before invasive procedures

## Delegation Principles

### RN Cannot Delegate:
- Assessment (initial)
- Planning care
- Teaching (initial)
- Evaluation
- Unstable patients
- IV push medications
- Blood products

### Can Delegate to LPN/LVN:
- Stable patients
- Routine tasks
- Data collection (not initial assessment)
- Medication administration (PO, SubQ, IM, some IV)
- Wound care
- Urinary catheter insertion

### Can Delegate to UAP:
- ADLs (bathing, feeding, toileting)
- Vital signs on stable patients
- Ambulation
- Positioning
- I&O measurement
- Simple specimen collection

**Right Task, Right Person, Right Circumstance, Right Communication, Right Supervision**

## Medication Questions

### Safety Rules
1. **Verify allergies** ALWAYS
2. **Check 6 Rights**: Right patient, drug, dose, route, time, documentation
3. **Hold if abnormal vital signs**:
   - HR <60 → Hold digoxin, beta blockers
   - BP <100 systolic → Hold antihypertensives
   - RR <12 → Hold opioids
4. **Assess BEFORE giving PRN** medications
5. **Educate about side effects**

### Common Traps
- **Sounds-alike drugs**: Watch for similar names
- **Math calculations**: Double-check your work
- **Route matters**: IM ≠ IV ≠ SubQ
- **Timing matters**: Before meals ≠ After meals

## Priority Patient Selection

### See First/Most Concern:
1. **Abnormal ABCs** - Airway, breathing, circulation issues
2. **Acute/Unstable** - New symptoms, deteriorating
3. **Post-op complications** - Hemorrhage, low O2, shock
4. **High-risk medications** - Adverse reactions
5. **Safety risk** - Fall risk, suicidal, confused

### See Last/Least Concern:
- Expected findings
- Stable chronic conditions
- Routine care needs
- Discharge teaching

## Common Testing Traps

### Trap 1: "Call the Doctor"
**Wrong if:** You can handle it within nursing scope
**Right if:** Outside nursing scope, unexpected serious change, need for orders

### Trap 2: All Answers Seem Right
**Strategy:** Choose the MOST right using ABC, Maslow, Safety, Nursing Process

### Trap 3: All Answers Seem Wrong
**Strategy:** Choose the LEAST wrong; eliminate what's dangerous

### Trap 4: Two Answers Are Opposites
**Strategy:** The answer is usually one of these two

### Trap 5: Unsure of Content
**Strategy:** Use common sense, safety first, patient-centered care

## Assessment vs. Implementation

### ASSESS FIRST When:
- Question asks for first action
- No immediate life threat
- Data is incomplete
- Unexpected finding

### IMPLEMENT FIRST When:
- Life-threatening emergency (ABC)
- Patient safety is at risk
- Question states assessment is complete
- Intervention is clearly needed

## Lab Values - When to Notify

### ALWAYS Report These:
- **Critical values** (see lab values chart)
- **Significant change** from baseline
- **Contraindication** to planned treatment
- **Therapeutic drug levels** outside range

### May Not Need to Report:
- **Expected findings** for the condition
- **Slight variations** within normal range
- **Chronic stable** lab abnormalities

## Special Populations

### Pediatric Tips
- **Family-centered care** - Include parents
- **Developmental level** - Not just age
- **Fear** - Most common concern (after ABC)
- **Play therapy** - Therapeutic intervention
- **Vital signs** - Use age-appropriate ranges

### Obstetric Tips
- **Two patients** - Mother AND baby
- **Fetal heart rate** priority over maternal
- **Preeclampsia** - BP, protein, reflexes
- **Hemorrhage** - Most common emergency

### Geriatric Tips
- **Polypharmacy** - Multiple medications = risk
- **Atypical presentations** - MI without chest pain
- **Fall risk** - High priority
- **Confusion** - Assess for reversible causes

### Psychiatric Tips
- **Safety** - Self or others
- **Therapeutic relationship** - Foundation
- **Milieu** - Therapeutic environment
- **Least restrictive** - First choice

## NCLEX-Specific Strategies

### Select All That Apply (SATA)
- Each option is True or False
- Need at least 2 correct (usually)
- There is no partial credit
- If unsure, use ABC/safety to decide

### Ordered Response
- Think step-by-step process
- Use nursing process if applicable
- Use ABC if applicable
- Logical sequence matters

### Fill in the Blank
- Calculate carefully
- Round appropriately
- Include units if asked
- Double-check math

### Exhibit/Chart
- Read ALL information provided
- Look for relevant vs. irrelevant data
- Note trends over time
- Compare to normal values

## Final Test-Day Tips

### Time Management
- **Average 1-2 min per question**
- Don't spend >2 min on any question
- Flag and move on if stuck
- Use all available time to review

### Mental Strategies
- **Read carefully** - Every word matters
- **Don't overthink** - First instinct often correct
- **Stay calm** - Anxiety clouds judgment
- **Positive mindset** - "I am prepared"

### During the Test
- **Read the last sentence first** - Know what's being asked
- **Reread with that focus** - Look for relevant information
- **Eliminate wrong answers** - Narrow choices
- **Choose best answer** - Not perfect, just best
- **Don't change answers** unless you misread
