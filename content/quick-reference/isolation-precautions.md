## Quick Decision Chart

|----------|--------|
| Most important infection control? | **Hand hygiene** |
| When to use soap vs alcohol rub? | **Soap for C. diff, norovirus, spore-forming organisms** |
| What mask for TB? | **N95 respirator** |
| What mask for flu? | **Surgical mask** |
| MRSA isolation? | **Contact** |
| Chickenpox isolation? | **Airborne + Contact** |
| Can patients with same infection room together? | **Yes (cohorting)** |
| Wet sterile field? | **Contaminated - replace** |
| Doubt about sterility? | **Consider contaminated** |

## Special Situations

### Combined Precautions

**Varicella (Chickenpox)**: Airborne + Contact
- N95 + Gloves + Gown + Negative pressure room

**Disseminated Herpes Zoster**: Airborne + Contact
- N95 + Gloves + Gown + Negative pressure room

**Localized Herpes Zoster** (in immunocompetent): Contact only
- Gloves + Gown (if uncovered)

## Room Requirements

| Type | Room Type | Door |
|------|-----------|------|
| **Airborne** | Negative pressure | Closed |
| **Droplet** | Private (or >3 ft) | Closed preferred |

## Transport Guidelines

| Isolation Type | Patient Wears | Staff Wears | Notes |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| **Airborne** | Surgical mask | N95 (before entry) | Minimize transport |

## NCLEX Tips

- **Hand hygiene is ALWAYS the answer** for "best prevention"
- **Most contaminated PPE removed first** = Gloves
- **N95 for small particles** (<5 microns) = Airborne
- **Surgical mask for large droplets** (>5 microns) = Droplet
- **Soap and water for C. diff** - alcohol doesn't work!
- **Negative pressure for airborne** (air flows IN)
- **When in doubt, use more protection**, not less
- **Private room** for airborne is mandatory
- **Non-immune staff** should avoid measles/varicella
